# Final Frame Analysis Report

The agent demonstrates a generally competent but inconsistent defensive strategy. Initially, it plays proactively, moving the paddle to successfully intercept the ball and clear several bricks, including one immediately after a wall bounce.

The key moment in the clip reveals a critical flaw. The agent's paddle remains completely stationary as the ball travels diagonally across the entire width of the screen, passing directly over it. A lost life is only avoided because the ball happens to strike the side wall. This highlights a significant lapse in the agent's reactive capabilities.

Following this near-miss, the agent’s behavior becomes less reliable. While it still makes successful returns, its positioning is sometimes reactive and at other times entirely static, creating high-risk situations. The agent’s performance is defined by this inconsistency: capable of skilled plays but prone to critical moments of inaction.
