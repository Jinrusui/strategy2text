The agent initially demonstrates proficient control, methodically clearing lower and mid-tier bricks through well-timed paddle movements and effective use of wall bounces. The gameplay peaks when the agent successfully traps the ball in a central channel, leading to a rapid cascade of high-value brick destructions and a significant score increase.

However, the agent's performance is ultimately undermined by a critical, repeated error. On two separate occasions following a ricochet, the ball descends on the opposite side of the screen from the paddle's location. In both instances, the agent fails to move the paddle across the screen to make the save, resulting in the loss of two lives. These moments of inaction stand in stark contrast to the agent's earlier precision and are the definitive cause of its setbacks in the clip. The recording concludes with the agent beginning play on one of its remaining lives.
