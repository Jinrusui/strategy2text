## Technical RL Policy Analysis

### Technical Analysis of Agent Policy

The agent's policy demonstrates both a sophisticated learned strategy and its inherent brittleness, leading to catastrophic failures.

**Key Moments & Analysis:**

*   **0:05 – 0:06 (Control Failure):** The agent loses a life due to a fundamental control error. The policy fails to move the paddle left to intercept the ball, suggesting an incomplete model for tracking the projectile's trajectory, especially near the boundaries.

*   **0:14 – 0:17 (Emergent Strategy):** The agent successfully executes a "tunneling" strategy. It deliberately creates a channel on the left side, allowing the ball to bounce behind the brick wall for rapid scoring. This is an advanced, non-obvious tactic indicating the agent has discovered an efficient exploit.

*   **0:17 – 0:18 (Policy Collapse):** The agent's failure highlights the strategy's fragility. The policy appears to have over-specialized, anticipating the ball's return down the left-side tunnel. When the ball unexpectedly breaks through and descends on the right, the agent’s control system is completely unresponsive, as its policy did not account for this outcome. This leads to an immediate loss of a life, followed by another quick loss (0:18-0:21) from poor reactive control, terminating the game.

The agent has optimized for a specific, high-reward pattern but lacks the general adaptability to recover when conditions deviate from that pattern.
