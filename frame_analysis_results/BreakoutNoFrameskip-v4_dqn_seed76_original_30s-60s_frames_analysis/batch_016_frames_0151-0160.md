Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins at the top-left, tunneling downwards and to the right through the wall of red bricks. After clearing the bricks, it continues on this path until it collides with the right wall. It then rebounds off the wall, changing its course to a downward and leftward trajectory, heading towards the paddle which is repositioning from the right to the center-left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves downwards and to the right at a steady speed, destroying two red bricks in its path. The score increases by 7 points for each brick hit (145 -> 152 -> 159). The paddle is stationary on the far right.
*   **Images 3-7:** The ball continues its consistent downward-right trajectory, tunneling through and destroying three more red bricks. The score continues to increase in increments of 7 (159 -> 166 -> 173 -> 180).
*   **Images 7-8:** Having cleared the brick wall, the ball travels freely in open space downwards and to the right, maintaining its speed until it makes contact with the right-side wall. The paddle remains on the far right.
*   **Images 8-10:** After striking the wall, the ball rebounds sharply and now travels downwards and to the left. In response to the ball's new path, the paddle begins moving from the far right towards the left to intercept it.
