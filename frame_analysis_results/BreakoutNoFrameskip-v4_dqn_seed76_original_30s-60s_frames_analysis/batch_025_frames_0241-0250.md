Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball is launched from the paddle at the bottom-left, travels in a straight diagonal line upwards and to the right, strikes the rightmost blue brick, and then rebounds on a new trajectory downwards and slightly to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-8:** The ball travels at a constant speed on a straight diagonal path, moving upwards and to the right. It is on a clear collision course with the blue row of bricks. The paddle remains stationary in the bottom-left corner.
*   **Images 8-9:** The ball makes contact with and breaks the rightmost brick in the blue row. This impact causes the brick to disappear, the score to change from 001 to 002, and the ball's vertical direction to be reversed.
*   **Images 9-10:** Now on a new trajectory, the ball begins moving downwards and continues its path to the right, heading towards the lower-right side of the screen. The paddle has not moved from its initial position.
