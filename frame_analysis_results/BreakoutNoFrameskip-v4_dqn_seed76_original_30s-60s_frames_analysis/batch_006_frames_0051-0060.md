Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the middle-right portion of the screen and travels in a straight diagonal line towards the bottom-right corner. It is missed by the paddle and exits the play area, resulting in the loss of a life. A new ball is then served, appearing stationary on top of the paddle, awaiting launch.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the right. The paddle, initially on the right, makes a small, ineffective move to the left before attempting to move back right in Image 5, ultimately failing to position itself for interception.
*   **Image 6:** The ball has now moved past the paddle and off the screen. This event triggers a loss of life, which is reflected in the score display as the middle digit changes from `3` to `2`. A new ball instantly appears, resting stationary on the right side of the paddle.
*   **Images 7-10:** The new ball remains completely still on top of the paddle. The paddle also remains stationary. The game is in a "ready" state, waiting for the player to launch the ball and resume play.
