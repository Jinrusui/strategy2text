Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the provided Breakout sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory just above the right side of the paddle, traveling in a straight line upwards and to the left. It strikes a central brick in the bottom-most (blue) row, causing it to rebound downwards and to the left along a new path, heading towards the left side of the play area.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a constant speed upwards and to the left. The paddle remains completely stationary on the bottom right.
*   **Image 6:** The ball makes contact with a blue brick near the center of the wall. This impact breaks the brick, changes the score from `000` to `001`, and initiates a change in the ball's direction.
*   **Images 7-10:** Now on a new trajectory, the ball travels downwards and to the left at a constant speed. The paddle has not moved from its original position on the right.
