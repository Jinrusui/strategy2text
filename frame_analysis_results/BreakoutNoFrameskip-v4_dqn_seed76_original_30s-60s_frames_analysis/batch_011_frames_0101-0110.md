Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the provided game sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the upper-right quadrant, moving downwards and to the right. It ricochets off the side wall, changing its path to travel downwards and to the left. The ball then strikes a green brick on the left side, causing it to rebound again, this time moving downwards and to the right. The sequence concludes as the ball descends towards the paddle, which has repositioned itself from the right to the left side of the screen in anticipation of an interception.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball travels at a steady speed downwards and to the right. The score changes from 091 to 092, indicating a brick was destroyed just as the sequence began. In Image 3, the ball makes contact with the right wall. The paddle remains stationary on the right side of the screen.
*   **Images 4-6:** Having rebounded off the wall, the ball now moves downwards and to the left. In response to the ball's new trajectory, the paddle begins moving from the right towards the left to get into position.
*   **Images 7-8:** Between frames 6 and 7, the ball strikes a green brick on the left side. This is confirmed by the score increasing from 092 to 093. The collision alters the ball's path, which now moves downwards and slightly to the right. The paddle continues its movement to the left.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues its descent downwards and to the right. The paddle has now stopped moving and is stationary on the left side of the screen, perfectly positioned to intercept the approaching ball.
