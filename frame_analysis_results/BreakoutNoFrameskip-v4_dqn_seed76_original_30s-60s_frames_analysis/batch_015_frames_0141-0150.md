Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its path just above the paddle, traveling upwards and to the right. It strikes a green brick, ricochets downwards into the right wall, and then caroms across the screen to the left. It then strikes another set of bricks on the left side, causing a final rebound that sends it downwards and to the right toward the moving paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves at a constant speed upwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary on the far left of the screen.
*   **Images 3-4:** The ball strikes a green brick. Its trajectory is immediately reversed, now moving downwards and to the right at a similar speed. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball continues its downward-right trajectory until it collides with the right wall. The paddle has not moved.
*   **Images 7-8:** After rebounding from the wall, the ball travels downwards and to the left. It hits a green brick on the left side of the wall. The paddle is still stationary.
*   **Images 9-10:** Having struck the green brick (and the orange one below it), the ball's path is altered once more, now heading downwards and to the right. The paddle finally moves from its starting position, sliding to the right to intercept the ball.
