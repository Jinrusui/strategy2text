Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins mid-screen, descending towards the left. It is successfully intercepted by the paddle, causing it to rebound upwards and to the left. After striking a brick in the top row, it ricochets off the left wall, reversing its horizontal direction. The ball then travels on a consistent downward-right path, successively destroying three more bricks in the top row before the sequence ends.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a steady pace downwards and to the left. The paddle is initially stationary but moves slightly to the left in Image 4 to position itself under the ball's path.
*   **Image 5:** The ball makes contact with the left side of the paddle. Its trajectory is sharply reversed, and it now travels upwards and to the left.
*   **Image 6:** Continuing its upward-left path, the ball strikes and destroys a red brick in the top row. This is confirmed by the score changing from 180 to 187.
*   **Images 7-8:** The ball rebounds from the brick, moving down and to the left. Between these frames, it strikes the left wall, which reverses its horizontal direction. It now moves downwards and to the right, immediately striking a second red brick, increasing the score to 194.
*   **Image 9:** The ball continues on its downward and rightward trajectory, hitting a third red brick. The score increases from 194 to 201.
*   **Image 10:** Maintaining its path, the ball destroys a fourth consecutive red brick, and the score updates from 201 to 208. The ball is still moving downwards and to the right at the end of the sequence.
