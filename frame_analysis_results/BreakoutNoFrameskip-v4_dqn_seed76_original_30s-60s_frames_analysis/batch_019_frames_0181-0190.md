Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its ascent from just above the paddle, traveling upwards and to the left. It ricochets off the left wall, changing its path to an upward-right trajectory. This path culminates in a collision with the leftmost green brick, after which the ball begins to descend towards the left side of the screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball travels at a constant speed upwards and to the left, heading directly for the side wall. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom right.
*   **Images 4-5:** The ball collides with the left wall and rebounds, its trajectory immediately changing. It now moves upwards and to the right with the same constant speed.
*   **Images 6-9:** The ball continues steadily on its upward-right path, directly approaching the wall of bricks. In Image 9, it makes contact with the leftmost green brick.
*   **Image 10:** Having just destroyed the brick (indicated by the small white particle effects), the ball's trajectory has reversed. It is now moving downwards and to the left. The paddle has not moved throughout this entire sequence.
