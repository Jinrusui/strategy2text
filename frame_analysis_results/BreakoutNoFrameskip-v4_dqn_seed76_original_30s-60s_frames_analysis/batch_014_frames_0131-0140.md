Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its ascent from the paddle, traveling up and to the left to strike a green brick. It then rebounds, moving down and to the right, where it clips an orange brick just before ricocheting off the right wall. Finally, its path reverses again, sending it down and to the left towards the paddle's starting position.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves steadily upwards and to the left after bouncing off the paddle. The paddle makes a small adjustment to the left and then holds its position.
*   **Images 4-5:** The ball strikes a green brick. This collision reverses its trajectory, and it now moves downwards and to the right. The score updates from 109 to 113.
*   **Images 5-8:** The ball continues its path downwards and to the right at a constant speed, heading towards the right side of the screen. The paddle remains stationary on the left.
*   **Images 8-9:** The ball strikes an orange brick and immediately ricochets off the right wall. This event changes its horizontal direction, and it now travels downwards and to the left. The score increases from 113 to 117.
*   **Images 9-10:** Continuing its rebound from the wall, the ball moves downwards and to the left. The paddle shifts slightly further to the left, positioning itself to intercept the ball.
