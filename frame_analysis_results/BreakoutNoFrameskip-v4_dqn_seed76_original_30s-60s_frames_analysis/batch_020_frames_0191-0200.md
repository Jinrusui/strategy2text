Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates from a just-broken brick on the left side of the upper block. It travels in a straight diagonal line down and to the right until it collides with the right wall. From there, it rebounds down and to the left, where it is intercepted by the paddle positioned on the far-left side. The ball then rebounds sharply upwards and to the right, striking the ceiling and breaking a top-row brick.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball appears, having just destroyed a brick (score changes from 236 to 243). It begins moving at a steady pace downwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary on the far left.
*   **Images 3-6:** The ball continues its constant downward-right trajectory, moving across the screen towards the right wall. The paddle does not move.
*   **Images 7-8:** Between frames 6 and 7, the ball strikes the right wall and its horizontal direction is reversed. It now travels downwards and to the left, heading directly for the stationary paddle.
*   **Image 9:** The ball makes contact with the left side of the paddle and rebounds at a steep angle, now moving quickly upwards and to the right.
*   **Image 10:** The ball travels the entire height of the play area, striking the ceiling and breaking a red brick (score increases from 243 to 250). The final frame captures the ball just after it has bounced off the ceiling and is beginning to descend.
