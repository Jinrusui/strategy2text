Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its ascent from just above the paddle, traveling upwards and to the left. It ricochets off the left wall and continues moving upwards and to the right until it strikes a green brick. This collision reverses its vertical direction, sending it on a steady downward path towards the left side of the screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball travels at a moderate, consistent speed upwards and to the left. In anticipation of a wall bounce, the paddle drifts slowly to the left.
*   **Images 3-5:** Between frames 3 and 4, the ball strikes the left wall. Its trajectory inverts horizontally, and it now moves upwards and to the right, maintaining its speed. The paddle continues its slow leftward movement.
*   **Images 5-7:** The ball collides with a green brick on the left side of the formation between frames 5 and 6. This impact reverses its vertical direction, and it begins to fall downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary on the left.
*   **Images 8-10:** The score updates from 055 to 059, confirming the hit on the green brick (worth 4 points). The ball continues its descent downwards and to the left. The paddle begins moving to the right to position itself for interception.
