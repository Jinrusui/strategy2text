Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the upper-middle portion of the screen and travels in a straight diagonal line down and to the left. It then strikes the left wall, causing it to rebound and change its path to a new diagonal line, moving down and to the right. The paddle remains stationary throughout the entire sequence.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a constant velocity, traveling diagonally downwards and to the left. The paddle is stationary, positioned near the bottom-center of the screen.
*   **Image 6:** Between the previous frame and this one, the ball has collided with the left wall. A bright pixel marks the point of impact on the wall. This collision reverses the ball's horizontal momentum, and its trajectory is now set downwards and to the right. The paddle remains unmoved. The score also updates from 044 to 048 in this frame.
*   **Images 7-10:** The ball continues on its new path, moving downwards and to the right at the same constant speed it had before the rebound. The paddle does not react and stays in its original fixed position, which is to the left of the ball's current path.
