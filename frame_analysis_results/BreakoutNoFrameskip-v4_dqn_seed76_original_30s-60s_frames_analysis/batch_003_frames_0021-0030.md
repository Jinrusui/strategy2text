Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the middle-left area of the screen, moving downwards and to the left. Its path leads it to strike a blue brick, causing a sharp rebound. The ball then travels upwards and to the left, continuing on a path toward the left wall.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a steady speed diagonally downwards and to the left. The paddle, anticipating the ball's path, shifts from a near-center position towards the left.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball collides with and destroys a blue brick on the left side. This impact causes the ball to reverse its vertical direction and the score to increase from 048 to 049.
*   **Images 6-10:** Following the rebound, the ball travels at a consistent speed diagonally upwards and to the left. The paddle, having moved left to anticipate the initial descent, now begins a slow drift back towards the right.
