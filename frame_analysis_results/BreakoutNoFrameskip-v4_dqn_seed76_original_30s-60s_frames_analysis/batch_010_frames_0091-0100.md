Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory just above the paddle, traveling in a straight, diagonal line upwards and to the right. It continues on this path until it strikes the rightmost green brick in the bottom row. Upon impact, the ball rebounds and begins a new trajectory downwards and to the left, heading back towards the paddle's position.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a constant speed upwards and to the right. The paddle remains completely stationary, positioned to the left of the screen's center.
*   **Image 6:** The ball's upward path concludes as it makes direct contact with the rightmost green brick. The paddle has not moved.
*   **Images 7-10:** Following the impact, the brick disappears, and the score increases from 084 to 091. The ball has reversed its vertical direction and is now moving at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary, positioned to potentially intercept the returning ball.
