Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its descent from the top-left, strikes the leftmost brick, and then travels diagonally downwards and to the right, breaking three more bricks in its path. After clearing the bricks, it continues its descent until it collides with the right wall and rebounds downwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves steadily downwards and to the left from its starting position at the top of the screen. The paddle is stationary at the bottom-left.
*   **Images 3-4:** Between frames 2 and 3, the ball strikes the leftmost yellow brick, causing its trajectory to reverse. It now moves downwards and to the right. In response, the paddle begins a slow movement to the right.
*   **Images 5-8:** The ball continues on its downward-right path at a consistent speed, successively striking three red bricks from the upper clusters. During this phase, the paddle stops its rightward movement and remains stationary on the left side.
*   **Images 9-10:** Having cleared the bricks, the ball continues its trajectory downwards and to the right. Between frames 9 and 10, it strikes the right wall and rebounds sharply, now moving downwards and to the left. The paddle remains on the far left, out of position for an interception.
