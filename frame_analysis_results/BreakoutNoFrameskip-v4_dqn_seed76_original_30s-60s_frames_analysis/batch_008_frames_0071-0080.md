Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey in the upper-left quadrant, descending towards the paddle. It reverses its vertical direction just before making contact, travels up to strike the left wall, and then rebounds diagonally across the screen to the top-right. After breaking a green brick, its path inverts, and it ends the sequence moving downwards on the right side of the playfield.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a consistent speed downwards and to the left. The paddle is positioned in the center-left and remains completely stationary, seemingly waiting for the ball.
*   **Images 5-7:** In a surprising turn, the ball reaches its lowest point and reverses its vertical direction *without* striking the paddle. It now travels upwards and to the left, away from the stationary paddle.
*   **Images 7-8:** The ball collides with the left wall and rebounds sharply. Its trajectory is now upwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Images 8-9:** Continuing its path across the screen, the ball moves steadily towards the right side of the brick wall. The paddle finally moves, shifting slightly to the left.
*   **Image 10:** The ball makes contact with a green brick on the right, causing it to break (confirmed by the score change from 066 to 073). This collision immediately reverses the ball's vertical direction, and it begins falling downwards and to the right. The paddle has continued its move to the left, away from the ball's new trajectory.
