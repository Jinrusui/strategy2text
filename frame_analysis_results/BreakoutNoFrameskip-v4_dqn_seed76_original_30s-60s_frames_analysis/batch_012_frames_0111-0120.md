Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the middle-left portion of the screen, moving towards the left wall. After bouncing off the wall, it travels diagonally down and to the right, where it is intercepted by the paddle. The resulting rebound sends the ball up and to the right, causing it to collide with and break a green brick. This final collision sends the ball on a new path downwards and to the right, which it follows for the remainder of the sequence.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball travels at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary, slightly left of the screen's center.
*   **Image 3:** Between frames 2 and 3, the ball strikes the left wall and rebounds, now moving downwards and to the right. In response, the paddle begins moving to the right. The score also increases from 093 to 097.
*   **Images 4-5:** The ball continues its descent while the paddle moves into position and successfully intercepts it. In Image 5, the ball has bounced sharply off the paddle and is now moving upwards and to the right.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball travels on a consistent upward and rightward path towards the wall of bricks. The paddle remains stationary after making the successful hit.
*   **Images 8-10:** In Image 8, the ball strikes and eliminates a green brick. Its trajectory immediately inverts, and it begins moving downwards and to the right. The score increases by one point to 098. The ball continues on this downward path for the rest of the sequence, while the paddle does not move.
