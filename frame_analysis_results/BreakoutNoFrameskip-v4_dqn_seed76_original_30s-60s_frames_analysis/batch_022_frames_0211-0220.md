Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the lower-middle portion of the screen and travels in a straight line upwards and to the right. It then ricochets off the right wall, changing its path to an upward-left trajectory. It proceeds to strike the top-right red brick, causing it to rebound downwards and to the left, where it immediately hits the top-left red brick and continues its descent.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a constant speed upwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-left corner of the playfield.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball collides with the right wall, sharply reversing its horizontal direction. It now travels upwards and to the left.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball continues moving upwards and to the left. Between frames 7 and 8, it strikes the red brick on the top row of the right-hand block. This collision is confirmed by the score changing from 282 to 289.
*   **Image 8-9:** After hitting the brick, the ball's vertical direction is reversed. It now travels downwards and to the left.
*   **Image 9-10:** The ball travels a very short distance before striking the red brick on the top row of the left-hand block. This second collision is confirmed by the score changing from 289 to 296. The ball continues its path downwards and to the left as the sequence ends. The paddle has not moved during the entire sequence.
