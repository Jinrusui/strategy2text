Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its path in the mid-left area of the screen, descending at a diagonal angle to the right. It strikes a low-lying green brick, causing it to rebound sharply upwards and to the right. This path continues until the ball collides with the right wall, which deflects it into an upward-left trajectory. Finally, the ball hits a higher, orange brick, which reverses its vertical direction, sending it downwards and to the left to end the sequence.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball travels at a steady speed downwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary at the bottom-center of the screen.

*   **Image 3:** The ball makes contact with a green brick on the far left of the bottom row. This collision causes the score to increase from 098 to 102.

*   **Images 4-6:** Following the impact, the ball's trajectory is inverted. It now moves at a consistent speed upwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary.

*   **Images 7-8:** The ball strikes the right-side wall, causing its horizontal motion to reverse. It rebounds off the wall and continues its trajectory upwards but now towards the left.

*   **Image 9:** The ball's ascent is interrupted by a collision with an orange brick in the second row from the top. This impact increases the score from 102 to 109.

*   **Image 10:** The impact with the orange brick reverses the ball's vertical direction. The sequence concludes with the ball now moving downwards and to the left. The paddle has not moved from its starting position.
