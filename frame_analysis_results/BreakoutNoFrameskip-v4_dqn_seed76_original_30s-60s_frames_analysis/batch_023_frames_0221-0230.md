Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
This sequence shows two distinct trajectories separated by a game reset. In the first event (Images 1-5), the ball travels in a straight diagonal line from the upper-left quadrant downwards and to the right. After the game resets between Images 5 and 6, a new trajectory begins. In this second event (Images 6-10), the ball is served from a central position and travels in another straight diagonal line downwards and to the right, heading toward the stationary paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball travels at a steady, constant speed downwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-left corner of the playfield.
*   **Image 5:** The ball continues its descent. In response, the paddle begins moving to the right to position itself for an interception.
*   **Between Images 5 and 6:** The game state undergoes a complete reset. The score changes from "303" to "000," the partially destroyed brick wall is fully restored, and the paddle is repositioned.
*   **Images 6-10:** A new ball is served. It moves at a constant speed on a diagonal path downwards and to the right. The paddle is now stationary on the bottom right, perfectly positioned to intercept the incoming ball.
