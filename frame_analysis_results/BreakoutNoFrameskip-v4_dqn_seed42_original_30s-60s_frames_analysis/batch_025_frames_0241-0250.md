Of course. Here is a detailed motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates in the lower-right quadrant of the screen, traveling at a steady angle upwards and to the left. Its path culminates in a collision with an orange brick on the left side of the upper wall. This impact reverses its vertical direction, sending it downwards and to the left, where it ultimately passes the stationary paddle and exits the playfield at the bottom-left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-7:** The ball moves consistently at a moderate speed in a diagonal direction, upwards and to the left. It traverses the open space, heading directly for the left section of the brick wall. The paddle remains completely still on the far-left side of the screen.
*   **Image 8:** The ball strikes and breaks an orange brick. This is confirmed by the score changing from 279 to 283. The collision immediately alters the ball's course; it now moves downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 9-10:** Continuing on its new trajectory, the ball descends towards the bottom of the screen. The paddle does not react or move to intercept, and the ball successfully passes it, leaving the field of play.
