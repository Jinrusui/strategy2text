# Batch 4: Frames 0031-0040

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory descending from the upper-middle area towards the right. It is intercepted by the paddle, causing it to rebound in a steep diagonal path upwards and to the right. The ball's ascent concludes when it strikes a green brick, after which it immediately ricochets off the right wall and begins a new descent downwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the right. The paddle moves deliberately to the right to position itself for a successful interception, coming to a stop directly beneath the ball's path.
*   **Image 4:** The ball makes contact with the paddle and sharply reverses its vertical direction. It now travels upwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Images 5-8:** The ball continues on its new, upward trajectory at a steady speed, maintaining a straight path towards the upper-right corner of the brick wall. The paddle does not move.
*   **Image 9:** The ball strikes and destroys a green brick. This collision immediately reverses its vertical velocity, causing it to travel downwards and to the right, directly towards the side wall.
*   **Image 10:** The ball ricochets off the right-side wall, which reverses its horizontal velocity. The ball is now traveling downwards and to the left. The score updates from 053 to 057, reflecting the points gained from breaking the green brick in the previous frame.
