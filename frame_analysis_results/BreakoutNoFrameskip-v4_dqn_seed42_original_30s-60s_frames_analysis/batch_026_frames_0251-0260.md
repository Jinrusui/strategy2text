Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins on the left side of the screen, having just destroyed a yellow brick. It travels briefly downwards and to the left, ricochets off the left wall, and then proceeds on a long diagonal path downwards and to the right. The paddle moves from the left to intercept the ball, successfully striking it at the bottom-right and causing it to rebound upwards and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves downwards and to the left. Between images 3 and 4, it strikes the leftmost yellow brick, confirmed by the score changing from 283 to 290 (yellow bricks are worth 7 points). The paddle remains stationary on the far left.
*   **Images 4-5:** The ball continues its path until it collides with the left wall, causing it to rebound. Its trajectory is now set downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 5-7:** The ball travels at a consistent speed diagonally across the screen. Seeing the new trajectory, the paddle begins to move to the right in image 7 to position itself for an interception.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball continues its steady descent. The paddle accelerates its movement to the right, successfully getting into position. In the final image, the paddle makes contact with the ball, causing a sharp rebound upwards and to the right.
