# Batch 3: Frames 0021-0030


### Overall Trajectory Summary:

The ball begins its visible trajectory by descending from the upper-right, bouncing off the right wall. Following an unobserved event where a brick is broken, the ball is then shown descending from the top-left. It travels diagonally down to the paddle, which is positioned in the center. After a successful rebound off the paddle, the ball arcs up towards the ceiling and begins to descend once more on the left side of the screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:

*   **Images 1-3:** The ball enters the frame moving downwards and to the right. Between Image 2 and 3, it strikes the right wall, causing it to rebound and begin traveling downwards and to the left.
*   **Image 4:** A significant time jump occurs between Image 3 and 4. The score has increased from 052 to 053, and a blue brick on the left has been destroyed. The ball is now positioned higher up and to the left, resuming a downward-left trajectory.
*   **Images 4-8:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary, correctly positioned for interception near the center of the screen.
*   **Images 8-9:** The paddle successfully intercepts the ball. The ball rebounds sharply upwards and to the left. It should be noted that the life counter changes from 4 to 3 in this frame, which appears to be an error as a life should not be lost on a successful block.
*   **Images 9-10:** After rebounding, the ball travels up off-screen, presumably hitting the ceiling, and starts its descent again. In anticipation, the paddle shifts quickly to the left to align itself for the next hit.
