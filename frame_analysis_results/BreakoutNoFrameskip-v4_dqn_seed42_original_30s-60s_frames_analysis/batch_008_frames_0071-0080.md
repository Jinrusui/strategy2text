# Batch 8: Frames 0071-0080

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its descent from the upper-left area of the screen, striking a blue brick. It then travels diagonally downwards and to the right until it is intercepted by the paddle on the left side of the screen. The resulting rebound sends the ball at a steep angle up and to the right, where it collides with a green brick and begins a new downward path from the upper-right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves downwards and to the right, immediately striking a blue brick. The impact changes the score from 070 to 071.
*   **Images 2-7:** After the rebound, the ball continues on a steady diagonal path downwards and to the right. The paddle, which was stationary on the far left, begins moving to the right in Image 6 to position itself for the interception.
*   **Image 8:** A rapid sequence of events occurs between frames 7 and 8. The ball first strikes the left side of the paddle, causing a sharp rebound upwards and to the right. It then travels across the screen and hits a green brick, changing the score to 078. Image 8 shows the immediate aftermath, with the ball now beginning to fall from this new point of contact.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball now moves downwards and slightly to the right, having rebounded off the green brick. In response to the new trajectory, the paddle reverses its direction and begins moving back to the left to prepare for the next interception.
