# Batch 14: Frames 0131-0140

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates at the top-right of the screen after striking a green brick. It then travels in a consistent diagonal line downwards and to the left, crossing the entire width of the play area. It misses the stationary paddle, strikes the lower-left wall, and rebounds sharply upwards and to the right, immediately colliding with a blue brick.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The sequence begins with the ball having just struck a green brick, evidenced by the score changing from 200 to 207. The ball's trajectory is now set, moving downwards and to the left. The paddle is stationary towards the right side of the screen.
*   **Images 3-8:** The ball continues its steady, constant-speed descent diagonally downwards and to the left. The paddle remains completely still, not reacting to the ball's path.
*   **Image 9:** The ball nears the bottom-left corner of the screen, about to make contact with the side wall. The paddle still has not moved.
*   **Image 10:** The ball strikes the left wall and ricochets upwards and to the right. In the same frame, it hits the lowest blue brick on the left, causing the score to increase to 211. The paddle has now moved to the far-left corner, but this movement was too late to intercept the ball before it hit the wall.
