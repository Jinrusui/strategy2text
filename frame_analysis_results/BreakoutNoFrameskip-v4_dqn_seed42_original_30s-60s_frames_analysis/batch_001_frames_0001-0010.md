# Batch 1: Frames 0001-0010

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the upper-middle section of the screen, descending towards the paddle. It is successfully intercepted by the paddle, causing it to rebound upwards and to the left. This rebound sends it into the wall of bricks, where it breaks a blue brick, and its path is redirected downwards and to the left, heading back towards the paddle which has started to move for a second interception.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball travels at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary, positioned slightly right-of-center, awaiting the ball's arrival.
*   **Image 5:** The ball makes contact with the left side of the stationary paddle. Its trajectory is immediately reversed, and it now moves upwards and to the left.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball continues its upward-left path until it collides with and breaks a blue brick. This event is confirmed by the score changing from 047 to 048 between frames 6 and 7.
*   **Images 8-9:** Following the collision with the brick, the ball's vertical direction is reversed again. It now moves steadily downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Image 10:** As the ball continues its descent, the paddle executes a quick move to the left, positioning itself to intercept the ball for a second time.
