# Batch 5: Frames 0041-0050

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the upper-middle section of the screen, descending at a gentle angle towards the right. It is successfully intercepted by the player's paddle, which is positioned at the bottom-center. The ball then rebounds, traveling upwards and to the right on a path nearly parallel to its initial descent.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a steady, moderate speed downwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-center, correctly positioned for the incoming ball.
*   **Image 5:** The ball makes contact with the right side of the paddle.
*   **Images 6-10:** Having bounced off the paddle, the ball's vertical direction is reversed. It now travels at a consistent speed upwards and to the right. The paddle stays in its fixed position after the successful interception.
