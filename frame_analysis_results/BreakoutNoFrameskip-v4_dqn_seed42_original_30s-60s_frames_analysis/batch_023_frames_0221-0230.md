Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory from the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the lower-left quadrant, traveling downwards and left until it is intercepted by the paddle. It rebounds sharply, moving diagonally upwards and to the right across the screen. Its ascent is stopped when it collides with and destroys a green brick in the upper-right section of the wall. The ball's trajectory is then reversed, and it proceeds to travel downwards and to the right, heading towards the paddle which has repositioned itself for the next hit.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball travels at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle is positioned statically at the far-left of the play area. In Image 3, the ball makes contact with the paddle.
*   **Images 4-5:** Having rebounded off the paddle, the ball now moves at a steady pace upwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Image 6:** The ball collides with a green brick on the right side of the brick wall, causing the brick to vanish and the score to increase from 268 to 275. This impact reverses the ball's vertical momentum, and it begins moving downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 7-10:** The ball continues its descent steadily downwards and to the right. In response to the ball's new path, the paddle begins moving deliberately to the right, positioning itself to intercept the ball at the bottom of the screen.
