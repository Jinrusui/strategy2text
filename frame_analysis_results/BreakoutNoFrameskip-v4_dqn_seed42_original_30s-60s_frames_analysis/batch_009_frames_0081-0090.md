# Batch 9: Frames 0081-0090

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins mid-screen, descending towards the left side. It is successfully intercepted by the paddle, which rebounds it upwards and to the left to destroy a single blue brick. This collision reverses the ball's vertical momentum, sending it back downwards and to the left on a path that concludes with it striking the left wall.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle, positioned slightly left of center, moves further to the left to align itself for a successful interception in Image 3.
*   **Images 4-5:** The ball rebounds sharply off the paddle, traveling upwards and to the left. It collides with and destroys a blue brick (note the score changes from 078 to 085). This impact immediately reverses the ball's vertical direction, and it begins moving downwards and left again.
*   **Images 5-9:** With a consistent trajectory, the ball travels downwards and to the left across the screen. During this phase, the paddle remains stationary, holding its position near the bottom-left corner.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball reaches the end of its path and collides with the left wall. The paddle makes a final slight shift to the left, pressing against the wall to prepare for the subsequent rebound.
