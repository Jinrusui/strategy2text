Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its descent from below the main brick formation, traveling downwards and to the left. It strikes and destroys the leftmost brick, causing it to rebound and change its course to downwards and to the right. The paddle moves from the right side of the screen to the left to intercept the ball near the bottom-left corner, causing a sharp rebound upwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left, heading towards the side wall. The paddle, initially on the far left, moves steadily to the right.
*   **Images 4-5:** In Image 4, the ball collides with the leftmost yellow brick. This impact destroys the brick (confirmed by the score changing from 260 to 264) and reverses the ball's horizontal direction. In Image 5, the ball is now moving downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball continues on its new trajectory, moving consistently downwards and to the right. The paddle reverses its course and begins moving to the left to position itself for an interception.
*   **Images 9-10:** The paddle successfully intercepts the ball on its left side in Image 9. This collision causes the ball to rebound sharply, and in Image 10, it is now moving upwards and to the left.
