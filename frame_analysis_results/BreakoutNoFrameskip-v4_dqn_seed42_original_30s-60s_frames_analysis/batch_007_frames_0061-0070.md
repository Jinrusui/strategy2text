# Batch 7: Frames 0061-0070

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The sequence begins just after the ball has struck a brick in the upper-right region. The ball travels in a straight diagonal line downwards and to the left across the screen. It then strikes the left wall, destroying a brick in the process, and ricochets, changing its path to move downwards and to the right towards the paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** These frames establish the initial state. The score is 065, and the paddle is positioned on the far left. A green brick is visible on the far right.
*   **Image 3:** An off-screen event has just occurred. The score has updated to 069, indicating the green brick (worth 4 points) was just destroyed. The ball now appears mid-screen, having rebounded from the hit, and is traveling at a constant speed downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 4-7:** The ball continues its steady diagonal movement downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary on the far left, anticipating the ball's path.
*   **Image 8:** The ball strikes the left wall and simultaneously destroys a blue brick (worth 1 point), increasing the score to 070. This collision reverses its horizontal direction, and it now moves downwards and to the right. The paddle begins its movement to the right to intercept.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues its descent on its new trajectory (down and right). The paddle also continues its smooth movement to the right, positioning itself under the ball's anticipated point of impact.
