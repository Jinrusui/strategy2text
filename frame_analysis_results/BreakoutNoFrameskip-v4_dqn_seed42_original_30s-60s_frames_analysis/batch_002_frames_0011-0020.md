# Batch 2: Frames 0011-0020

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the lower-left quadrant of the playfield, travels diagonally upwards and to the left, ricochets off the left wall, continues diagonally upwards and to the right to strike a blue brick, and then reverses its vertical direction, descending down and to the right towards the paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a steady pace upwards and to the left, heading directly for the side wall. The paddle, initially positioned on the far left, begins a slow and deliberate movement to the right.
*   **Images 5-6:** After striking the left wall (between frames 4 and 5), the ball rebounds sharply. It now travels at a constant speed upwards and to the right, towards the rows of bricks. The paddle continues its steady transit to the right.
*   **Images 7-8:** The ball collides with a blue brick (between frames 6 and 7), which is confirmed by the score changing from 048 to 052. The ball's trajectory immediately reverses, and it begins moving downwards and to the right. The paddle continues to adjust its position to the right to intercept.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues its steady descent. The paddle has now completed its rightward movement and holds its position, perfectly aligned under the ball's path, ready to make contact.
