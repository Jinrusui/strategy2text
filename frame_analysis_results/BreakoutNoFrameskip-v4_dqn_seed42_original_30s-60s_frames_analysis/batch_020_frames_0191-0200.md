Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory falling from the upper-left region of the play area. It travels downwards and to the right, clipping a green brick on its way down. The paddle moves from the left to intercept the ball near the bottom-right. After striking the paddle, the ball rebounds upwards and to the right, hitting another green brick. Finally, it bounces off this brick and resumes a path downwards and to the right towards the wall.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the right. Between images 2 and 3, it strikes the bottom of a green brick. This is confirmed by the score increasing from 241 to 245 and a piece of the brick disappearing. Unusually, the ball's trajectory is not altered by this impact. The paddle, initially on the far left, moves to the bottom-center to intercept.
*   **Images 4-5:** The ball continues its consistent descent. The paddle makes a final slight movement to the right, positioning itself perfectly. In image 5, the ball makes contact with the right side of the paddle.
*   **Images 6-7:** Following the impact with the paddle, the ball rebounds sharply, now traveling upwards and to the right at a constant velocity. The paddle remains stationary after the hit.
*   **Image 8:** The ball's ascent concludes as it collides with a different green brick located on the right side of the brick wall. This impact is confirmed by the score changing from 245 to 249.
*   **Images 9-10:** Rebounding off the brick, the ball's vertical direction is reversed. It now travels downwards and to the right, heading towards the side wall. The paddle stays in its last position at the bottom of the screen.
