# Batch 15: Frames 0141-0150

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its descent from the middle-left of the screen, traveling diagonally downwards and to the right. It strikes a green brick on the lower-right side of the brick formation, causing a rebound. The ball's trajectory then reverses, and it travels downwards and to the left across the screen, heading towards the paddle which has positioned itself for an interception on the bottom-left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the right. The paddle, initially on the far left, makes a small adjustment to the right in Image 2 before becoming stationary.
*   **Image 5:** The ball collides with a green brick. This is indicated by the disappearance of the brick and the score changing from 211 to 215.
*   **Images 6-7:** Having rebounded off the brick, the ball now moves downwards and to the left. The paddle, anticipating a bounce towards the center, moves to the right.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball continues its steady descent towards the left side of the screen. The player corrects the paddle's position, moving it back to the left to align with the ball's path, preparing to hit it in the final frame.
