Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins mid-screen, traveling downwards and to the right to strike a green brick. It then rebounds downwards and to the left across the playfield, where it is intercepted by the paddle positioned at the bottom-right. The subsequent rebound sends the ball on a steep trajectory upwards and to the right, where it strikes a red brick at the top of the wall before beginning its next descent.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball travels at a steady speed downwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary at the bottom-left. In Image 3, the ball strikes a green brick on the far right, which disappears.
*   **Image 4:** Having rebounded off the brick, the ball's trajectory has inverted; it now moves downwards and to the left. In response, the paddle has relocated quickly to the bottom-right to prepare for interception.
*   **Images 5-7:** The ball continues its steady descent towards the waiting paddle. The paddle remains stationary, perfectly positioned for the hit. In Image 7, the ball makes contact with the right side of the paddle.
*   **Image 8:** The ball rebounds sharply off the paddle, now moving at a fast speed upwards and to the right. The paddle begins to move back towards the left.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues its ascent. By Image 10, it has struck a red brick at the top-right of the wall and has started a new trajectory, moving downwards and to the right again. During this phase, the paddle has returned to the bottom-left corner of the screen.
