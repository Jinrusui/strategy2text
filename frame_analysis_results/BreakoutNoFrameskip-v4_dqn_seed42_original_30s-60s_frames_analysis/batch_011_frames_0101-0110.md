# Batch 11: Frames 0101-0110

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball travels in a straight, uninterrupted diagonal line from the middle-left region of the screen downwards towards the bottom-right corner. It maintains a constant velocity throughout its descent and is not intercepted by the paddle, ultimately exiting the playfield at the bottom right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball begins its visible trajectory on the left side, having just come from the upper rows of bricks. It moves at a constant speed downwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary, positioned slightly left of the center.
*   **Images 4-5:** The ball continues its steady diagonal movement. Between these frames, a blue brick on the far-left side of the wall disappears, and the score increases from 091 to 095. The ball's path, however, remains completely unaffected by this event on the opposite side of the screen.
*   **Images 5-9:** The ball continues its consistent path, moving steadily downwards and to the right, crossing the lower half of the screen. Throughout this entire phase, the paddle remains completely motionless.
*   **Image 10:** The ball passes the right edge of the stationary paddle and is about to be lost off the bottom of the screen, concluding the sequence.
