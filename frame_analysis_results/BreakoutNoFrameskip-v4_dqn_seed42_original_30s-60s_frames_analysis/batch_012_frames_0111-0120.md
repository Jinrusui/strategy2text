# Batch 12: Frames 0111-0120

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins at the top-right of the screen and travels in a consistent, straight diagonal line downwards and to the left. During its descent, it methodically breaks a series of five red bricks. It then continues falling until it is intercepted by the paddle, which has moved from the far-left to the bottom-right. The sequence ends as the ball rebounds sharply off the paddle, beginning a new path upwards and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball appears at the top-right, moving at a constant speed downwards and to the left. In this phase, it breaks its first visible red brick. The paddle remains stationary on the far-left of the screen.
*   **Images 4-5:** Continuing on its consistent diagonal path, the ball breaks a second red brick. In response to the ball's trajectory, the paddle begins a smooth movement from left to right.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball maintains its steady speed and direction, breaking three more consecutive red bricks in the top layer. The paddle accelerates its movement across the screen to the right, positioning itself for the anticipated interception.
*   **Images 9-10:** Having cleared the brick layer, the ball falls freely toward the paddle. The paddle, now stationary at the bottom-right, successfully intercepts the ball, causing a sharp rebound upwards and to the right.
