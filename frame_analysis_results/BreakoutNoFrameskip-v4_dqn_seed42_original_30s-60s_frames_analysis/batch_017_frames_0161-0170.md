Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the upper-middle left of the play area, traveling downwards and to the left. It is intercepted by the paddle positioned on the far left, causing a rebound upwards and left into the wall and a blue brick. This collision reverses the ball's path, sending it on a new trajectory downwards and to the right, where it heads towards the repositioned paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-left corner, awaiting the ball's arrival.
*   **Images 4-5:** Between frames 3 and 4, the ball strikes the paddle and rebounds sharply. It now travels at a constant speed upwards and to the left, heading towards the side wall. The paddle does not move.
*   **Image 6:** The ball makes contact with the left wall and a blue brick simultaneously between frames 5 and 6. This collision changes its course to downwards and to the right. The score increases from 227 to 231, confirming the brick was destroyed. The paddle begins moving to the right to track the ball's new path.
*   **Images 7-10:** The ball continues its consistent descent downwards and to the right. The paddle also continues to move right, positioning itself for the next interception. By the final frame, the ball is just above the right edge of the paddle.
