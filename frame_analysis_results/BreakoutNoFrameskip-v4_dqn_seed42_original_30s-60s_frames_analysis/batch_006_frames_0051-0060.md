# Batch 6: Frames 0051-0060

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey at the top-right of the screen, where it strikes a green brick. It then travels in a straight diagonal line downwards and to the left, crossing the entire play area. The paddle, positioned on the left, intercepts the ball, causing it to rebound sharply upwards and to the right, where it immediately strikes another brick before continuing its ascent.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball strikes a green brick on the far-right side of the wall. This collision reverses its direction, sending it downwards and to the left. The score updates from 057 to 061. The paddle is stationary on the left.
*   **Images 2-6:** The ball travels at a constant, moderate speed on a straight diagonal path towards the lower-left corner of the screen. The paddle makes a very slight adjustment to the right but remains on the left side, positioned to intercept.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball is successfully intercepted by the left side of the paddle. The impact causes the ball to rebound sharply, now moving upwards and to the right. In the same motion, it immediately collides with a low-hanging green brick on the left, and the score increases from 061 to 065.
*   **Images 7-10:** Following the two rapid-fire collisions (paddle then brick), the ball continues its new trajectory, moving steadily upwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary in its last position.
