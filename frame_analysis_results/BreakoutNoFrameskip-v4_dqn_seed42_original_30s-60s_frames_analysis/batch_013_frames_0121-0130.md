# Batch 13: Frames 0121-0130

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins at the top-right of the screen and becomes trapped in the upper area, executing a "breakthrough" maneuver. It travels in a short zig-zag pattern, first moving down-and-left to destroy two red bricks, then rebounding off the left wall to move down-and-right, destroying three more. Finally, it ricochets off the right wall and travels down-and-left again, breaking a brick in the second row before continuing its descent.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball appears at the top-right and moves downwards and to the left. It collides with the rightmost red brick, which disappears as the score increases from 151 to 158. The paddle remains stationary at the far-right edge of the screen.
*   **Images 3-5:** Continuing its downward-left trajectory, the ball immediately strikes the next red brick in the line (score increases to 165) and then travels through the newly created gap.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball hits the left wall (off-screen) and reverses its horizontal direction. Now moving downwards and to the right, it strikes a red brick on the left side of the gap, increasing the score to 172.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball continues moving steadily downwards and to the right, sequentially breaking two more red bricks. The score increases first to 179 and then to 186.
*   **Images 8-9:** Having cleared a path, the ball continues moving down and to the right into open space. In anticipation of the ball's descent, the paddle begins a deliberate movement from the right edge of the screen towards the left.
*   **Image 10:** The ball strikes the right wall, causing a sharp rebound downwards and to the left. It immediately collides with a brick in the second (orange) row, increasing the score to 193. The paddle continues its smooth motion to the left to position itself for interception.
