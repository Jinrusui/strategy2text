Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey in the upper-right area, having just struck a yellow brick. It travels diagonally downwards and to the left until it collides with the left wall. After the rebound, its path is inverted, moving downwards and to the right, where it is successfully intercepted by the paddle, which has moved into position. The ball then rebounds sharply upwards and to the right, striking a yellow brick.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball appears mid-screen, moving downwards and to the left at a steady speed. A score change from 166 to 170 indicates it has just destroyed a yellow brick. The paddle, initially on the left, moves slightly to the right.
*   **Images 2-6:** The ball continues on its constant downward-left trajectory. The paddle remains stationary near the left side of the screen.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball collides with the left wall, causing it to change horizontal direction.
*   **Images 7-9:** Having rebounded, the ball now moves downwards and to the right. In response, the paddle begins moving to the right to position itself for an interception.
*   **Images 9-10:** The paddle successfully intercepts the ball on its right side. The ball rebounds steeply upwards and to the right. This rebound is so immediate that by Image 10, the ball has already struck and destroyed a yellow brick, confirmed by the score changing from 170 to 177.
