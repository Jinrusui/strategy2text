Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the upper-left quadrant, traveling diagonally downwards and to the right. It is intercepted by the paddle, which is positioned near the bottom-right corner. The ball then rebounds sharply upwards and to the left, striking a red brick on the far-right side of the wall. This collision causes the ball to ricochet upwards and to the right, heading towards the top of the screen by the end of the sequence.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball travels at a constant speed downwards and to the right. It begins as a pink dot and changes to white as it descends. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-right, positioned for interception.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball makes contact with the right side of the paddle and rebounds. Its trajectory inverts, and it now moves upwards and to the left.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball continues its upward-left path until it collides with a red brick at the rightmost edge of the brick formation.
*   **Images 8-10:** After destroying the brick, the ball (now colored red) sharply changes its path. It now moves upwards and to the right at a constant speed. In response, the paddle begins moving slowly to the left, away from the right wall.
