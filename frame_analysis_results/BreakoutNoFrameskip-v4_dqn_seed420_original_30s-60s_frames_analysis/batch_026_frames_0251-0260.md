Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball travels from the upper-middle screen on a diagonal path downwards and to the left, where it is intercepted by the paddle. It then rebounds upwards and to the right, striking a green brick, which reverses its vertical direction, sending it on a final descent downwards and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary at the far-left edge of the playfield, positioned to intercept.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball strikes the paddle and rebounds sharply. Its trajectory is now upwards and to the right, moving at a consistent speed towards the block formation.
*   **Images 7-8:** The ball collides with a green brick, causing the score to increase from 332 to 336. The impact reverses the ball's vertical momentum, and it now travels downwards and to the right. In response, the paddle begins moving to the right.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues its descent downwards and to the right, having cleared the brick formation. The paddle continues its corresponding movement to the right to position itself for the next hit.
