Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The sequence begins immediately after the player loses a life, resulting in the appearance of a new ball at a central serving position. This new ball travels at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle, initially positioned near the left wall, moves left to intercept the ball. After making contact, the ball rebounds sharply upwards and to the left, heading towards the upper-left corner of the playfield.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The sequence starts with a major game event. The ball from Image 1 disappears, and the score changes from 4 lives to 3, indicating a life was lost. A new ball is then served, appearing stationary in the upper-center of the screen. The paddle makes a slight initial movement away from the far-left wall.
*   **Images 3-6:** The new ball begins its descent, moving at a steady, moderate speed on a diagonal path downwards and to the left. In response, the paddle begins moving leftward from its starting position to align with the ball's anticipated path.
*   **Image 7:** The ball makes contact with the right side of the paddle. The paddle has stopped its movement, having successfully positioned itself for the interception.
*   **Images 8-10:** After striking the paddle, the ball's trajectory is sharply reversed. It now travels at a consistent speed upwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary following the successful rebound.
