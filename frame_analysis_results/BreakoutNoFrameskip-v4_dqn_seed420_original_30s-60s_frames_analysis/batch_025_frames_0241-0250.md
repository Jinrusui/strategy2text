Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins on the right side of the screen, traveling upwards and to the right. It strikes a red brick in the top row, which reverses its vertical trajectory. The ball then descends diagonally to the right until it collides with the side wall, causing it to ricochet downwards and to the left, continuing on this new path for the remainder of the sequence.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball travels at a constant speed upwards and to the right. Between images 2 and 3, it collides with a red brick, immediately reversing its vertical direction to move downwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary on the far left.
*   **Images 4-6:** The ball continues its descent downwards and to the right. Between images 5 and 6, it strikes the right-side wall, which reverses its horizontal direction. The ball now travels downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Images 7-10:** The ball maintains a steady trajectory, moving downwards and to the left across the screen. It travels from the right wall towards the lower-left quadrant. The paddle does not move throughout this entire sequence.
