Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins mid-screen and travels in a straight line upwards and to the left. It strikes and destroys a brick in the top row, causing it to reverse direction. The ball then travels diagonally downwards and to the right across the entire play area, ultimately striking the right wall in the final frame. The player's paddle remains stationary throughout the sequence.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves steadily upwards and to the left, heading towards the upper-left corner of the brick wall. The paddle is stationary near the bottom-left.
*   **Image 5:** The ball collides with and destroys a reddish-brown brick in the top row. This is the moment of impact.
*   **Image 6:** The score updates from 290 to 297, confirming the destruction of the brick. Having bounced off the brick, the ball's trajectory is now reversed, and it begins moving downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 7-9:** The ball continues its new trajectory, moving at a constant speed downwards and to the right. The paddle remains unmoved at the bottom of the screen.
*   **Image 10:** The ball reaches the far right of the screen and makes contact with the side wall, preparing to rebound off of it.
