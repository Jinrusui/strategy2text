Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its descent from just below the central brick formation, traveling downwards and to the right. It strikes a brown brick, causing it to ricochet down and to the left. The ball then bounces off the right-side wall, continues its downward-left trajectory, and finally strikes an orange brick, sending it on a new path upwards and to the left by the final frame.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves steadily downwards and to the right. In Image 3, it makes contact with the rightmost brown brick in the wall. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-left.
*   **Images 3-4:** The ball rebounds off the brown brick, changing its trajectory to downwards and to the left. The score increases from 279 to 283, indicating a successful hit.
*   **Images 4-7:** The ball continues its consistent descent towards the bottom-left. In response, the paddle begins a slow, deliberate movement to the right, positioning itself for a potential interception.
*   **Images 7-8:** The ball collides with the right-side vertical wall and rebounds off it, maintaining its general downward and leftward direction.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball continues its path until it collides with the rightmost orange brick in Image 10. This impact causes the score to jump from 283 to 290 and sharply reverses the ball's vertical direction, sending it upwards and to the left.
