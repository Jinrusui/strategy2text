Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey in the lower-left quadrant, descending towards the paddle. After being successfully returned by the paddle, it travels diagonally upwards and to the right, destroying a green brick along the way. It then ricochets off the right wall, changing its direction to upwards and to the left, where it finally collides with an orange brick in the upper-right section of the playfield.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves steadily downwards and to the right. The paddle, initially on the left, moves rightwards to position itself for interception, making contact with the ball in Image 3.
*   **Images 4-5:** The ball rebounds off the paddle, now traveling at a consistent speed upwards and to the right. Between these frames, it strikes and destroys a green brick, causing the score to increase from 072 to 073.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball continues its ascent upwards and to the right. The paddle keeps moving slowly to the right. In Image 8, the ball collides with the right-side wall.
*   **Images 9-10:** After ricocheting off the wall, the ball's trajectory shifts to upwards and to the left. Between these final frames, it hits an orange brick, causing the score to jump from 073 to 077.
