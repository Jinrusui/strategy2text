Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey near the top-center of the screen, initially moving down and left. It immediately strikes a blue brick, causing its trajectory to reverse. For the remainder of the sequence, the ball travels in a consistent, straight diagonal line downwards and to the right, crossing the entire width of the playfield. It ends just before making contact with the right wall.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball travels downwards and to the left. The paddle is stationary on the far left side of the screen.
*   **Image 3:** The ball makes contact with a blue brick, confirmed by the score changing from 244 to 251. This impact reverses the ball's horizontal direction, and it now begins moving downwards and to the right. The paddle remains unmoved.
*   **Images 4-9:** The ball continues on its new trajectory, moving at a constant speed diagonally down and to the right. The paddle stays in its original position at the bottom-left, making no attempt to intercept.
*   **Image 10:** The ball reaches the far right side of the screen, continuing its steady descent. It is now positioned just before it would strike the right-hand wall.
