Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey high on the left, travels downwards to strike the left wall, and then ricochets towards the right. Its path is intercepted by a low-hanging green brick, causing the ball to reverse its vertical direction and travel steeply upwards and to the right. After bouncing off the ceiling, the sequence concludes with the ball beginning its descent back towards the paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle is stationary, positioned to the right of the center.
*   **Image 4:** The ball collides with the left wall, causing its horizontal direction to reverse. It now travels downwards and to the right, away from the wall. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball continues its descent and strikes a green brick. This collision reverses its vertical direction, sending it upwards and to the right. The score changes from 159 to 166. In response, the paddle begins to move left.
*   **Images 7-9:** The ball continues on its upward and rightward trajectory at a constant velocity. The paddle completes its move to the left of center and becomes stationary, repositioning for the ball's eventual return.
*   **Image 10:** The ball strikes the top boundary (ceiling) and rebounds. It is now moving downwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary, waiting to intercept.
