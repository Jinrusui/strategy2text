Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images from Breakout.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball descends from the upper-right portion of the screen in a steady diagonal path towards the left. The paddle moves from the left to the center to intercept it. Upon striking the paddle, the ball rebounds sharply upwards and to the left, immediately destroying a yellow brick and continuing its ascent toward the left side of the screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle, initially positioned left-of-center, begins a smooth movement to the right to position itself for interception.
*   **Images 4-6:** The ball continues its steady diagonal descent. The paddle also continues its deliberate movement to the right, successfully aligning itself directly in the ball's path just before impact.
*   **Transition from Image 6 to 7:** A critical sequence of events occurs. The ball strikes the paddle, causing it to rebound sharply upwards and to the left. The ball's new trajectory immediately carries it into the rightmost yellow brick, which is destroyed, causing the score to change from 90 to 97.
*   **Images 7-10:** Following the rebound and brick break, the ball continues its ascent upwards and to the left at a constant speed. The paddle remains stationary in the center, having successfully returned the ball into play.
