Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey just above the paddle, travels upwards and to the right, and strikes a low-hanging yellow-orange brick. Following the collision, the ball reverses its vertical direction and proceeds on a long, steady diagonal descent downwards and to the right, heading directly towards the stationary paddle positioned at the bottom-right of the screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball, initially a white pixel, moves at a constant speed upwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary on the far right side of the screen.
*   **Image 3:** The ball collides with and destroys a yellow-orange brick. This impact causes the ball to change color to pink and immediately reverse its vertical momentum. It now begins moving downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 4-10:** The pink ball continues its descent at a steady, unchanging speed along a straight diagonal path. It travels across the empty space, getting progressively closer to the paddle, which remains motionless in its path, ready for interception.
