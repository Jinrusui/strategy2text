Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates in the upper-left quadrant of the playfield. It travels downwards and to the left, strikes a blue brick, and immediately rebounds. Its new path is downwards and to the right, on a clear trajectory toward the paddle, which is initially positioned on the right side of the screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle is stationary, positioned in the lower-right quadrant.
*   **Images 4-5:** Between image 3 and 4, the ball collides with the leftmost blue brick. This collision reverses its horizontal direction, and it now travels downwards and to the right. The paddle does not move.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball continues its steady descent downwards and to the right. Between image 7 and 8, the score at the top of the screen updates from "106" to "110," confirming the successful break of the brick.
*   **Images 9-10:** As the ball approaches the paddle's level, the paddle makes a small, deliberate shift to the left to perfectly align itself for interception. The ball continues on its consistent path downwards and to the right.
