Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey after being struck by the paddle on the left side of the screen. It travels on an upward-left angle, strikes a green brick, and then rebounds on a downward-right path across the screen. After hitting a blue brick on the far right, its path reverses again, sending it downward and to the left, where the paddle moves across to intercept it, sending it on a final upward-right trajectory.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball travels at a steady speed upwards and to the left. The paddle, having just launched the ball, begins moving rightward toward the center of the screen.
*   **Image 3:** The ball strikes a green brick. This is confirmed by the score changing from 097 to 101. The ball's trajectory immediately reverses, and it now moves downwards and to the right. The paddle continues its slow drift to the right.
*   **Images 4-7:** The ball continues its consistent descent downwards and to the right, heading toward the right wall. The paddle stops its movement and holds its position near the center.
*   **Image 8:** The ball collides with a blue brick on the far right side of the wall. The score increases from 101 to 105, and the ball's horizontal direction reverses. It now travels downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 9-10:** As the ball descends toward the paddle, the paddle moves to the right to position itself for the interception. In the final frame, the paddle successfully strikes the ball, causing a sharp rebound upwards and to the right.
