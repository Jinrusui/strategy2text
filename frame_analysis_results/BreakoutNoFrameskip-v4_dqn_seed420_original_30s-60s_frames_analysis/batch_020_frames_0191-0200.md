Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The sequence depicts two distinct ball trajectories. First, a ball travels from the top-right of the screen diagonally downwards and to the left, passing the paddle and exiting at the bottom. After a life is lost, a new ball is launched from the paddle on the left, beginning a new trajectory upwards and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** A single white/pink ball travels at a steady, moderate speed downwards and to the left from its starting point near the top-right corner. The paddle remains stationary on the far-left side.
*   **Image 5:** The ball continues its descent and is about to pass the paddle's horizontal plane. The paddle begins moving to the right in a failed attempt to intercept it.
*   **Image 6:** The first ball has gone off-screen at the bottom, resulting in a lost life (the middle score digit changes from `3` to `2`). A new ball is immediately launched from the paddle, appearing on the left side and beginning to move upwards. The paddle has now relocated to the far-right side.
*   **Images 7-10:** The new ball travels at a consistent speed diagonally upwards and to the right. Concurrently, the paddle moves steadily from the right towards the center, repositioning for the ball's eventual return.
