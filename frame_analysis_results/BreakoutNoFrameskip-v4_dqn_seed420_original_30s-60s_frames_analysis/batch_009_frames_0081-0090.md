Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the upper-right area, descends diagonally to the left, and strikes a blue brick. It then rebounds downwards and to the right, travels across the screen, and is intercepted by the paddle on the bottom-left. From the paddle, it rebounds sharply upwards and to the left, hitting another blue brick before beginning its final descent downwards and to the right as the sequence ends.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle is stationary on the bottom-left side of the screen.
*   **Image 3:** The ball strikes a blue brick. This is confirmed by the score changing from 110 to 117. The paddle has not moved.
*   **Images 4-7:** Having rebounded from the brick, the ball now travels at a steady speed downwards and to the right, heading directly for the paddle. The paddle remains in its fixed position.
*   **Image 8:** The ball makes contact with the left portion of the stationary paddle.
*   **Image 9:** The ball rebounds sharply off the paddle, now moving upwards and to the left at a steep angle. The paddle is still stationary.
*   **Image 10:** The ball strikes a second blue brick on the far left, causing the score to increase from 117 to 124. The ball has just begun its new trajectory, moving downwards and to the right. The paddle has remained stationary throughout the entire sequence.
