Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory at the top-right corner, having just bounced off the side wall. It travels in a straight line downwards and to the left, striking and destroying a red brick along the way. The paddle intercepts the ball on the right side of the screen, causing a sharp rebound upwards and back towards the right wall. The sequence concludes as the ball makes contact with the right wall and begins a new descent.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves steadily downwards and to the left from the top-right of the screen. Between images 2 and 3, it strikes a red brick, which is confirmed by the score changing from `184` to `191`.
*   **Images 4-6:** The ball continues its constant velocity descent, moving downwards and to the left, heading towards the paddle which remains stationary on the right side of the playfield.
*   **Images 7-8:** The stationary paddle successfully intercepts the ball between images 6 and 7. The ball's trajectory is immediately reversed, and it begins moving rapidly upwards and to the right.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues its ascent towards the right wall. Between images 9 and 10, it strikes the wall and rebounds, starting to move downwards and to the left again. The paddle has not moved during this entire sequence.
