Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the provided game sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory on the left side of the screen, moving downwards towards the paddle. After being struck by the paddle at the bottom-left, it travels in a long, straight diagonal line up to the top-right corner, where it collides with and destroys a brick before starting its descent.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves steadily downwards and to the left. The paddle, positioned on the left, makes a small adjustment to the right to align itself for interception. The score remains at 145.
*   **Images 3-4:** The ball is struck by the paddle, causing a sharp rebound. Its direction completely reverses, and it now moves quickly upwards and to the right. During this action, the score updates from 145 to 152.
*   **Images 4-9:** The ball travels at a constant, high speed in a straight diagonal line, moving from the bottom-left towards the top-right of the screen. The paddle remains stationary on the left, its task complete for the moment.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball collides with and destroys a green brick on the far right side. This causes the score to increase from 152 to 159. The ball immediately rebounds from the collision, beginning a new trajectory downwards and to the left.
