Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey near the top-right of the screen, having just broken a brick. It travels in a straight line downwards and to the left, breaking two more red bricks along the way. Upon reaching the left edge of the playfield, it ricochets off the side wall, reversing its horizontal direction. The ball then proceeds downwards and to the right, heading towards the paddle positioned near the bottom-center.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves steadily downwards and to the left. The score is 297, and the paddle is stationary near the bottom-left corner.
*   **Images 2-3:** The ball strikes a red brick, and the score increases from 297 to 304. The ball continues its trajectory downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 4-5:** The ball hits another red brick. The score updates from 304 to 311. Its direction remains unchanged, continuing downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 6-7:** Having cleared the brick formation, the ball travels unimpeded until it collides with the left wall.
*   **Image 8:** The ball rebounds off the left wall. Its trajectory is now downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues its descent towards the paddle. In response, the paddle has made a small adjustment to the right to prepare for interception.
