Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins the sequence by rebounding off a blue brick in the lower-left section of the brick wall. It travels downwards and to the left, ricochets off the left wall, and immediately strikes a yellow brick. This second collision reverses its horizontal direction, sending it on a new path downwards and to the right towards the paddle, which is actively repositioning for an interception.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The sequence starts just as the ball strikes a blue brick. This collision is confirmed by the score changing from 131 to 138. The ball's upward momentum is reversed, and it begins moving downwards and to the left. In response, the paddle begins a slow, deliberate movement to the right.
*   **Images 3-6:** The ball maintains a constant speed and a straight trajectory, moving downwards and to the left towards the side wall. The paddle continues its steady movement to the right, anticipating the ball's path after it ricochets off the wall.
*   **Images 6-7:** A rapid, multi-part collision occurs. The ball hits the left wall (unseen between frames), bounces upwards to strike a yellow brick (causing the score to increase from 138 to 145), and its horizontal direction is reversed. The ball is now traveling downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 8-10:** Following the rebound off the yellow brick, the ball continues its new trajectory downwards and to the right at a constant speed. The paddle, having anticipated the general area of the rebound, now reverses its own direction and begins moving left to intercept the ball.
