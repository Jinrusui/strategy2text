Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory from the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball travels in a V-shaped path, first descending from the upper-middle of the screen to the bottom-left to strike the paddle, rebounding sharply upwards to destroy a blue brick, and then descending once more to be intercepted by the stationary paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle is stationary at the bottom-left of the screen, positioned for the incoming ball.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball strikes the paddle and rebounds upwards and to the left. In the next frame, it immediately makes contact with and destroys a blue brick in the wall.
*   **Images 7-9:** After hitting the brick, the ball's trajectory reverses. It now travels downwards and to the left, once again heading directly for the paddle.
*   **Image 10:** The ball makes contact with the paddle for a second time, beginning its rebound upwards and to the right. The paddle has remained completely stationary throughout the entire sequence.
