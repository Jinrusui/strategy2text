Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The sequence captures the ball completing a full cycle. The ball enters the frame from the top right after striking a brick off-screen. It then travels at a constant velocity diagonally downwards and to the left. The paddle intercepts it on its left side, causing a sharp rebound upwards and to the right, where it immediately strikes and destroys another brick near the top wall.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The sequence begins with the ball off-screen. Between these two frames, it strikes a yellow brick (worth 7 points), causing the score to increase from 166 to 173. The ball appears in Image 2, having just rebounded, now moving downwards and to the left. The paddle is stationary on the left.
*   **Images 3-8:** The ball maintains a steady, linear trajectory, moving downwards and to the left across the open play area. The paddle remains completely stationary, positioned to intercept the incoming ball.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball makes contact with the left portion of the paddle and rebounds sharply. Its direction is now upwards and to the right. Immediately following the rebound, it strikes another yellow brick, confirmed by the score changing from 173 to 180 in the final frame. The paddle moves slightly to the right after impact.
