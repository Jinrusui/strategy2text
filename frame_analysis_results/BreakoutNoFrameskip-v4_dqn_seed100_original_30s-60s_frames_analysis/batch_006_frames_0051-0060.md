Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the mid-right section of the screen, traveling diagonally downwards and to the right. It is intercepted by the paddle near the right wall, causing it to rebound upwards and to the right. After striking the right wall, its path reverses, and it travels on a long diagonal trajectory downwards and to the left across the entire playfield. The sequence concludes as the paddle successfully moves to the far left to intercept the ball again.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the right. The paddle moves from a central position towards the right to meet the ball's path.
*   **Image 4:** The ball makes contact with the right side of the paddle, initiating a rebound.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball rebounds off the paddle, now traveling upwards and to the right at a consistent speed. The paddle is momentarily stationary on the right side.
*   **Image 7:** Having struck the right wall (between frames 6 and 7), the ball's trajectory is now inverted. It begins moving downwards and to the left. In response, the paddle begins moving left.
*   **Images 8-9:** The ball continues its steady diagonal descent across the screen. The paddle mirrors this movement, moving at a constant speed to the left to position itself for interception.
*   **Image 10:** The paddle successfully intercepts the ball on the far left side of the screen, making contact and ending the sequence just as the ball begins to rebound.
