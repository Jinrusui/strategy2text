Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory at the top-right of the playfield, just above the bricks. It travels in a steep diagonal path downwards and to the left, sequentially destroying two red bricks. The paddle moves to the bottom-left corner to intercept the ball, causing a sharp rebound upwards and to the left. This rebound immediately causes the ball to destroy two more orange bricks before it strikes the left wall and ricochets back towards the upper-right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball appears above the right-hand bricks and moves downwards and to the left. It strikes the topmost red brick, which disappears, and the score updates from 310 to 317.
*   **Images 3-5:** After the first collision, the ball continues its constant velocity downwards and to the left. It proceeds to strike the second red brick (on the left side), which disappears as the score updates from 317 to 324.
*   **Images 5-7:** Continuing its descent from the second brick collision, the ball heads towards the bottom-left corner. The paddle slides into the frame from the left to position itself for an interception, making contact in Image 7.
*   **Images 7-8:** The paddle makes a successful block, causing the ball to rebound sharply upwards and to the left. The rebounding ball immediately collides with and destroys the orange brick just above it, increasing the score to 331.
*   **Images 8-9:** The ball continues its path upwards and to the left, striking the small remaining orange brick fragment. This collision increases the score to 338 just as the ball reaches the left wall.
*   **Images 9-10:** Having made contact with the left wall, the ball ricochets off it and begins a new trajectory upwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-left.
