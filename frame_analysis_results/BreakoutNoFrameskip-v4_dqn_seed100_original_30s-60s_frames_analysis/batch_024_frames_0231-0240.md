Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball travels at a constant diagonal angle downwards and to the right, strikes the right wall, and then rebounds, beginning a new path downwards and to the left towards the paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-8:** The ball descends from the upper-middle portion of the screen, moving at a steady speed downwards and to the right. Throughout this phase, the paddle remains completely stationary near the bottom-left corner.
*   **Image 9:** The ball makes contact with the right wall, causing an immediate and sharp rebound. Its horizontal direction is reversed, and it now moves downwards and to the left.
*   **Image 10:** The ball continues on its new trajectory away from the wall. In response to the rebound, the paddle begins moving to the right to position itself for interception.
