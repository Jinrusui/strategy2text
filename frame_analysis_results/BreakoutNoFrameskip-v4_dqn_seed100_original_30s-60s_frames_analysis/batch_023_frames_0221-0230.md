Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates on the upper-left side of the screen and travels in a straight diagonal line downwards and to the right. It moves across the majority of the screen before striking the right wall, at which point it rebounds and begins moving downwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-8:** The ball travels at a constant speed on a consistent diagonal path, moving downwards and to the right. The paddle, visible at the bottom left, remains stationary throughout this entire phase after an initial small adjustment between images 1 and 2.
*   **Image 9:** The ball makes contact with the right wall, causing a perfect rebound.
*   **Image 10:** The ball's trajectory has reversed horizontally. It is now moving at the same constant speed but directed downwards and to the left. The paddle has not moved to intercept and remains on the far left side of the screen.
