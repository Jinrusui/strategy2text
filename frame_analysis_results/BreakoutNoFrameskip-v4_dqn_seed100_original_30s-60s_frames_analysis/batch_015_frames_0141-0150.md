Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The provided image sequence shows the ball's trajectory in three distinct, non-continuous phases. Initially, the ball is shown having cleared bricks in the upper-left and center, moving downwards. The sequence then cuts to the ball descending on the right side. Finally, it shows a continuous sequence where the ball is intercepted by the paddle near the bottom-left and rebounds back up into the play area.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The sequence opens with the ball positioned stationary at the top-left, just below the score. In response to anticipated action, the paddle moves slightly to the right from its starting position on the far left.
*   **Images 3-4:** A jump in the action occurs. The ball is now shown moving steadily downwards and to the left, having just destroyed two red bricks from the top row (indicated by the score increasing from 250 to 264).
*   **Images 5-6:** The sequence jumps again. The ball now appears on the right side of the screen, moving downwards after destroying a brick on the far right (score increases to 271). The paddle has shifted its position from the left towards the center.
*   **Images 7-9:** This segment shows a continuous motion. The ball descends from the right side, traveling downwards and slightly to the left. The paddle moves into position to intercept it.
*   **Image 10:** The paddle successfully intercepts the ball. The ball makes contact with the left side of the paddle and rebounds sharply, now moving upwards and to the left.
