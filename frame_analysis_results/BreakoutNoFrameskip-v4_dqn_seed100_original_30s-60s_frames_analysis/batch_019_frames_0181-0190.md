Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its descent from the upper right portion of the screen, traveling in a steep, nearly vertical path. It is successfully intercepted by the paddle, which is positioned at the bottom-left of center. The ball rebounds sharply upwards and to the left, striking the bottom corner of the leftmost brick, before beginning a new descent downwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-7:** The ball moves at a constant speed, descending steeply from the top right. Its horizontal movement is very slight. The paddle remains completely stationary, positioned to intercept the ball's predictable path.
*   **Image 8:** A major event occurs between frames 7 and 8. The ball has struck the paddle, rebounded upwards and left, and collided with the lowest part of the leftmost brick. This is confirmed by the score changing from 345 to 349. The ball is now seen starting a new trajectory, moving downwards and to the left from the point of impact.
*   **Images 9-10:** Following the rebound off the brick, the ball continues its new path, traveling at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle has not yet moved from its successful intercept position.
