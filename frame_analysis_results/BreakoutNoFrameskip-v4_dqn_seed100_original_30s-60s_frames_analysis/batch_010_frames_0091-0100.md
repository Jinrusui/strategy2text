Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory moving downwards and to the left. It is intercepted by the paddle near the bottom-left of the screen, causing it to rebound sharply upwards and to the right. On its ascent, it strikes and destroys a blue brick, continuing its path until it collides with the right wall, after which it changes direction to move upwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball travels at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle, initially positioned near the center, moves left to intercept the descending ball.
*   **Images 4-5:** Between Image 3 and 4, the paddle successfully intercepts the ball. The ball rebounds, now moving upwards and to the right. Simultaneously, it strikes a blue brick, which vanishes as the score updates from 151 to 155. The paddle remains stationary after the hit.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball continues its ascent steadily upwards and to the right, traveling across the screen towards the right-hand wall.
*   **Images 9-10:** In Image 9, the ball makes contact with the right wall. By Image 10, it has rebounded off the wall, altering its trajectory to move upwards and to the left.
