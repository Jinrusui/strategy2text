Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory from the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball travels in a straight, uninterrupted diagonal line from the upper-middle left of the screen towards the bottom-right. Its path is aimed directly at the paddle, which repositions itself from the far-left to the far-right to intercept it.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a constant speed, traveling downwards and to the right. During this phase, the player's paddle remains completely stationary on the far-left side of the screen.
*   **Image 6:** The ball continues its predictable descent. Reacting to the ball's trajectory, the paddle abruptly moves from its starting position on the left all the way to the far-right edge of the screen.
*   **Images 7-10:** With the paddle now in position, the ball continues along its straight path at the same constant speed. The paddle remains stationary on the right, perfectly aligned to intercept the ball as it reaches the bottom of the screen. The sequence ends just before impact.
