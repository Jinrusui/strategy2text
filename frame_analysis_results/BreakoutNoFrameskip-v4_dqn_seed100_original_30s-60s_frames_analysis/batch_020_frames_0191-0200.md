Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the lower-central area of the screen, moving downwards and to the right. It strikes the paddle, which is positioned at the bottom-right, and rebounds in a long, steep path upwards and to the left. After striking the left wall near the remaining bricks, the ball's trajectory is inverted, and it begins descending downwards and to the right, ending the sequence in the lower-middle portion of the screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the right. The paddle is positioned on the far right and remains stationary to intercept the ball. In image 3, the ball makes contact and rebounds sharply upwards and to the left.
*   **Images 4-6:** The ball travels at a constant speed on its new upward-left trajectory. In response to the rebound, the paddle begins a slow, steady movement from the right side towards the center.
*   **Images 7-8:** The ball strikes the left vertical wall, causing it to rebound. Its direction inverts, and it now travels downwards and to the right. The paddle continues its deliberate movement towards the center of the screen.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues its descent at a steady speed. The paddle keeps moving slowly to the left, positioning itself centrally to intercept the ball on its downward path.
