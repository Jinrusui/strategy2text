Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the upper-right area of the screen and travels in a straight diagonal line downwards and to the left. After striking and destroying a blue brick, it continues its descent until it collides with the left wall. Upon impact, it simultaneously destroys a green brick and rebounds, reversing its horizontal direction. The ball then travels downwards and to the right, heading towards the paddle, which begins moving left to intercept it.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball is initially moving downwards and to the left. Between Image 2 and Image 3, it collides with and destroys a blue brick, causing the score to increase from 129 to 136. The ball continues on the same downward-left trajectory.
*   **Images 3-7:** The ball continues its descent at a constant speed and angle, moving steadily downwards and to the left across the screen. The paddle remains stationary near the bottom-center.
*   **Images 7-8:** In a single event between these frames, the ball strikes the left wall, its horizontal direction reverses, and a green brick is destroyed, increasing the score from 136 to 140. The ball is now moving downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 8-10:** Following the rebound, the ball travels downwards and to the right. In response to the ball's new trajectory, the paddle begins moving from the center towards the left to position itself for the upcoming interception.
