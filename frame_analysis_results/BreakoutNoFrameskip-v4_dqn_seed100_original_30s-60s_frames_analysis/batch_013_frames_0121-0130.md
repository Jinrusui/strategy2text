Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory at the top-center of the screen, travels downwards and to the left, and strikes a green brick. It then rebounds downwards and to the right, crossing the playfield until it is intercepted by the paddle near the bottom-right. Finally, it bounces sharply off the paddle, moving upwards and to the right until it collides with the side wall.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves downwards and to the left from its starting position just below the score. The paddle is on the left side and begins a slow, deliberate movement to the right.
*   **Images 2-3:** The ball's descent continues, and it collides with a green brick. The impact destroys the brick and reverses the ball's horizontal direction.
*   **Images 3-6:** Now moving downwards and to the right, the ball travels across the screen. The paddle continues its slow, steady movement to the right, anticipating the ball's path.
*   **Images 6-8:** The paddle stops moving and holds its position as the ball approaches. Between frames 7 and 8, the ball makes successful contact with the right side of the paddle.
*   **Images 8-10:** Rebounding off the paddle, the ball now moves at a constant speed upwards and to the right. It travels across the empty space and strikes the right wall between frames 9 and 10. The paddle remains stationary.
