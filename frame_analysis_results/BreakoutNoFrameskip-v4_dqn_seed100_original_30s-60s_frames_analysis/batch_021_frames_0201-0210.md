Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory from the bottom-center of the screen, just above the paddle. It travels diagonally upwards and to the left, striking one of the lowest bricks in the formation. After the collision, the ball reverses its vertical direction and begins a steady descent downwards and to the left, heading towards the right-hand side of the paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed upwards and to the left. In Image 3, it collides with a blue-green brick, causing the score to increase from 354 to 358. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-left during this phase.
*   **Images 3-5:** Following the collision, the ball immediately rebounds. Its trajectory is now downwards and to the left, maintaining a consistent speed. The paddle has not yet moved.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball continues its descent downwards and to the left. In response to the ball's new path, the paddle begins a smooth, deliberate movement to the right, starting to position itself for an interception.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball maintains its steady downward and leftward course. The paddle continues its corresponding movement to the right, closing the distance. By Image 10, the paddle is positioned directly under the ball's path, with a collision about to occur.
