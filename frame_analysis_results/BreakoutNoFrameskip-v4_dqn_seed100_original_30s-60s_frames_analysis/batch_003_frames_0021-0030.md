Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins low and to the left, moving upwards until it strikes the left wall. It rebounds off the wall, traveling up and to the right, where it hits a blue brick. This collision sends the ball on a downward path towards the right. The stationary paddle intercepts the ball, causing a sharp rebound upwards and to the left. The ball's journey in this sequence concludes as it strikes a green brick in the upper-left area of the brick wall.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball travels at a steady speed upwards and to the left. In Image 3, it makes contact with the left wall. The paddle remains stationary below.
*   **Images 4-5:** Rebounding off the wall, the ball now moves upwards and to the right. In Image 5, it collides with a blue brick, and the score updates from 101 to 102.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball's trajectory is now downwards and to the right. It falls steadily until it is intercepted by the right edge of the stationary paddle in Image 8.
*   **Images 9-10:** After striking the paddle, the ball rebounds sharply, moving quickly upwards and to the left. In Image 10, it hits a green brick, causing the score to jump from 102 to 106 and initiating the ball's next downward movement.
