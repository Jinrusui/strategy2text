Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its visible trajectory in the lower-left quadrant, descending towards the paddle. After bouncing off the paddle (an unseen event between frames), it travels upward to destroy an orange brick on the right. Its path then reverses, and it descends diagonally toward the left wall. In another unseen event, the ball ricochets off the left wall, travels up to strike a second orange brick, and the sequence ends as it begins its new descent downwards and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the right. It appears to be falling after having previously hit the blue brick above it. The paddle remains stationary, positioned to the left of the center, anticipating the interception.

*   **Between Images 3 and 4:** A significant sequence of events occurs off-camera. The ball hits the paddle, rebounds upwards and to the right, and strikes an orange brick. This is confirmed by the score changing from 093 to 097 (orange bricks are worth 4 points). The ball's trajectory is now reversed.

*   **Images 4-9:** Following the rebound, the ball travels steadily downwards and to the left. In response, the paddle begins moving from its initial position to the left, tracking the ball's new path to position itself for the next hit near the left wall.

*   **Between Images 9 and 10:** Another key event happens between frames. The ball, which was about to hit the left wall, ricochets off it, travels upwards and to the right, and strikes another orange brick. This is confirmed by the score increasing from 097 to 101.

*   **Image 10:** The final frame shows the ball after its second rebound, now moving downwards and to the right. The paddle is positioned on the far left, having successfully anticipated the wall bounce but now needing to move right to intercept the ball's latest trajectory.
