Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates near the top center-right of the screen and travels in a straight line downwards and to the right. It strikes the right-side wall, causing it to ricochet. Its new trajectory is downwards and to the left, heading directly towards the paddle which remains stationary at the bottom-right of the screen for the entire sequence.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-6:** The ball moves at a constant speed diagonally downwards and to the right. It travels across the screen, passing the rightmost cluster of bricks. The paddle is positioned on the far bottom-right and does not move.
*   **Image 7:** The ball makes contact with the right wall and rebounds sharply. Its horizontal direction is now reversed, and it begins moving downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball continues on its new trajectory, moving steadily downwards and to the left. It travels directly towards the waiting paddle, which stays in its fixed position, prepared for interception. The sequence ends just before the ball makes contact with the paddle.
