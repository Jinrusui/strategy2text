Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey in the upper-left quadrant, traveling diagonally downwards and to the right. It strikes a green brick, causing it to rebound and change direction. The ball then proceeds on a new path downwards and to the left, heading towards the paddle which moves to intercept it near the bottom-center of the screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the right. In Image 3, it collides with a green brick. The paddle remains stationary in the center-left portion of the playfield.
*   **Images 4-6:** Following the collision, the ball has ricocheted and now travels downwards and to the left at a steady pace. The score updates from 125 to 129, confirming the destruction of the green brick. The paddle does not move.
*   **Images 7-10:** The ball continues its descent towards the paddle. In response, the paddle begins a smooth, deliberate movement to the right. By Image 10, the paddle has successfully positioned itself directly underneath the ball, preparing to intercept it.
