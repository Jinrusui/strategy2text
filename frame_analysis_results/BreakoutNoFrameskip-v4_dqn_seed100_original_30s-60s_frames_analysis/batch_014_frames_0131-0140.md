Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory low and right-of-center, moving upwards to strike the right wall. It then caroms left into the top layer of red bricks, where it rebounds downwards, then upwards, then off the left wall, and finally downwards again as it breaks a series of three bricks in rapid succession.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a constant speed upwards and to the right. It strikes the right wall between Image 3 and Image 4. The paddle remains stationary on the left side of the screen.
*   **Images 4-6:** After rebounding off the right wall, the ball travels at the same speed upwards and to the left, heading towards the upper rows of bricks. The paddle begins a slow, deliberate movement to the left.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball strikes the highest red brick, causing the score to increase from 222 to 229. Its trajectory inverts, and it now moves downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 7-9:** The ball continues its descent and strikes a second red brick (between images 8 and 9, score increases to 236). Its vertical path inverts again, sending it upwards and to the left towards the side wall.
*   **Images 9-10:** In a quick sequence, the ball strikes the left wall and immediately ricochets into a third red brick (score increases to 243). This final collision sends the ball on a new path downwards and to the right. The paddle has remained stationary at the far left during this phase.
