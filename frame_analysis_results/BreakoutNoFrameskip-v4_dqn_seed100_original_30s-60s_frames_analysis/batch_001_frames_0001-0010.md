Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins mid-screen, traveling downwards and to the right. It strikes a green brick, causing it to rebound upwards and right into the side wall. After bouncing off the wall, it travels downwards and to the left, where it hits a higher-level orange brick. This second collision sends the ball on its final trajectory upwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the right. In Image 3, it strikes and destroys a green brick, indicated by the score changing from 088 to 089. The paddle is stationary at the bottom-center.
*   **Images 4-6:** The ball's trajectory is now inverted; it travels upwards and to the right. It maintains a consistent path until it collides squarely with the right-side wall in Image 6.
*   **Images 7-8:** After rebounding off the wall, the ball moves downwards and to the left. In Image 8, it strikes and destroys an orange brick. This impact is confirmed by the score increasing from 089 to 093.
*   **Images 9-10:** Following the second collision, the ball again reverses its vertical direction, now moving upwards and to the left. Throughout this entire sequence, the paddle remains completely stationary.
