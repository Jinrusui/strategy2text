Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its path moving downwards and to the right, where it is struck by the paddle. It rebounds upwards and to the right, hits a green brick, and then reverses direction, heading downwards and to the right again. The paddle moves to intercept a second time, successfully striking the ball and sending it on a final upward-right trajectory.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves steadily downwards and to the right. The paddle, initially positioned slightly left, shifts to the right to intercept the ball.
*   **Images 3-4:** Having struck the paddle, the ball rebounds at a constant speed, now traveling upwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Image 5:** The ball collides with a green brick in the bottom row, causing the brick to vanish and the score to change from 106 to 113. The ball's trajectory reverses, and it begins moving downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball descends towards the paddle. In response, the paddle moves smoothly to the right to get into position, stopping in Image 8 to await the ball's arrival.
*   **Images 9-10:** The paddle makes successful contact with the ball, causing a second rebound. The ball is now moving upwards and to the right, away from the stationary paddle.
