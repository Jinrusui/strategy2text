Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball descends from the mid-left, is intercepted by the paddle, rebounds up and to the right, strikes a blue brick near the top of the playfield, and then begins a new descent downwards and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle is stationary, positioned in the center-left of the screen.
*   **Image 3:** The ball makes contact with the left side of the stationary paddle, initiating a rebound.
*   **Images 4-5:** Having rebounded, the ball now travels at a constant speed upwards and to the right, heading towards the wall of bricks. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Image 6:** The ball strikes a blue brick, causing the brick to disappear and the score to increase from 062 to 063. This collision reverses the ball's vertical direction.
*   **Images 7-10:** The ball now moves at a steady speed downwards and to the right. The paddle does not move from its original position throughout this entire sequence.
