Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory from the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its descent from the upper-middle section of the screen, moving downwards and to the right. After striking the right-hand wall, it reverses its horizontal direction and travels downwards and to the left. Its path then intersects with the bottom row of bricks, causing it to rebound sharply upwards and to the left, where it immediately strikes another brick in the row above.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the right, heading towards the side wall. In anticipation, the paddle begins a slow, steady movement from the left towards the right side of the screen.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball makes contact with the right wall and ricochets, its trajectory now changing to downwards and to the left. The paddle continues its deliberate movement to the right to position itself for a potential interception.
*   **Image 8:** The ball collides with the lowest red/orange brick on the right. The brick is destroyed, and the score updates from 302 to 309. The paddle has now reached the right side of the screen and becomes stationary.
*   **Images 9-10:** As a result of hitting the brick, the ball rebounds sharply upwards and to the left. Between frames 9 and 10, it immediately strikes the yellow brick directly above the previous impact point. This second brick is destroyed, and the score increases from 309 to 313. The ball's motion is reset at the point of the new impact, poised to travel downwards again.
