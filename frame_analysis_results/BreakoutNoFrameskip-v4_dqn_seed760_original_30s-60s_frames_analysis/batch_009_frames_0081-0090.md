Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates from the top-left after breaking a brick, travels diagonally downwards and to the right, and then strikes the right wall. Its path reverses, sending it downwards and to the left until it hits the left wall, rebounds to break another brick, and finally falls downwards and to the right towards the paddle, which makes a last-second adjustment to intercept it.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The sequence starts immediately after the ball has destroyed a green brick, with the score updating from 105 to 112. The ball appears and begins moving at a constant speed downwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary at the bottom-left.
*   **Images 2-6:** The ball maintains its steady diagonal trajectory, moving downwards and to the right across the screen. The paddle does not move.
*   **Images 6-7:** Between these frames, the ball strikes the right wall, causing its horizontal momentum to reverse. It is now moving downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Images 7-8:** A complex series of events occurs between these frames. The ball travels to the left wall, ricochets off it, and strikes another green brick on the far left. This action causes the score to increase from 112 to 116. The ball's trajectory is now set on a new path downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball continues its final descent downwards and to the right. In the last frame, the paddle makes a slight, deliberate move to the right, perfectly positioning itself under the ball for the imminent interception.
