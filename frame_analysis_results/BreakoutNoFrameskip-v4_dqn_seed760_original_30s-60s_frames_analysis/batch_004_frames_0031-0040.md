Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the middle-left portion of the screen, just below the rows of bricks. It travels in a short, steep path downwards and to the left, where it strikes and destroys the leftmost green brick. Immediately after, it rebounds off the left wall and travels in a consistent diagonal line downwards and to the right across the play area, heading for an interception with the paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-left corner of the screen.
*   **Image 5:** The ball makes contact with the leftmost green brick. The score at this point is still 64.
*   **Images 6-10:** The ball has now rebounded off the left wall, and its trajectory is reversed. It moves steadily downwards and to the right. The score has updated to 65, confirming the destruction of the brick. In response to the ball's new path, the paddle moves smoothly from the left towards the center, positioning itself directly under the ball for a successful interception. The sequence ends just before the ball makes contact with the paddle.
