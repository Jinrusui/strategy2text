Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates from the bottom-left of the screen, traveling diagonally upwards and to the right. It strikes a yellow brick in the center of the brick wall, causing the brick to vanish. The ball then rebounds off the brick, reversing its vertical direction, and proceeds to move downwards and to the right towards the bottom of the screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-8:** The ball travels at a constant speed in a straight diagonal line, moving upwards and to the right. It is on a clear path toward the central cluster of bricks. The paddle remains completely stationary at the bottom-left corner during this phase.
*   **Image 9:** The ball makes contact with and destroys a yellow brick. The score updates from 356 to 360. This collision causes the ball to rebound, and its trajectory is now set downwards and to the right.
*   **Images 9-10:** Following the rebound, the ball continues its descent downwards and to the right. In anticipation of the ball's new path, the paddle begins to move to the right, shifting its position slightly to prepare for an interception.
