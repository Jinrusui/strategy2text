Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the upper-left quadrant and travels a short distance down and to the right to strike and eliminate a single orange brick. This collision reverses the ball's horizontal direction, sending it on a long, diagonal path downwards and to the left. The ball travels across the screen until it is intercepted by the paddle, which is waiting at the far-left edge, and then rebounds upwards and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves downwards and to the right at a steady speed. It is on a direct collision course with the lone orange brick on the right side of the screen. The paddle is stationary at the far-left bottom edge.
*   **Images 2-3:** The ball strikes the orange brick, which disappears. This impact causes the ball to rebound, reversing its horizontal momentum. It now begins moving downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 3-9:** The ball travels at a consistent speed and angle on a long, uninterrupted path downwards and to the left. During this entire descent, the paddle remains completely motionless, positioned against the left wall to intercept the ball.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball makes contact with the left side of the stationary paddle. It rebounds sharply, its trajectory now shifting upwards and to the right. Immediately after the rebound, the paddle begins to move slowly to the right.
