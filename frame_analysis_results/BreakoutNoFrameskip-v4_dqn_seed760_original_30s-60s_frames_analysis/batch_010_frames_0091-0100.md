Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the middle of the screen, descending at a diagonal angle towards the left. The paddle, initially on the left, moves right to intercept it near the center. After rebounding off the paddle, the ball travels sharply upwards and to the right, striking a green brick. This collision reverses its vertical momentum, and the ball ends the sequence moving downwards and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle is positioned on the bottom-left and remains stationary. The score updates from 116 to 120 between images 2 and 3, indicating a brick was broken just before this sequence.
*   **Images 4-7:** The ball continues its constant descent towards the left. The paddle begins a smooth, continuous movement to the right, positioning itself to intercept the ball.
*   **Image 8:** The ball makes contact with the right edge of the paddle, which has successfully moved into the ball's path.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball rebounds sharply upwards and to the right. It immediately collides with and destroys a green brick, causing the score to increase from 120 to 124. This impact changes its course, and by Image 10, the ball is now moving downwards and to the right.
