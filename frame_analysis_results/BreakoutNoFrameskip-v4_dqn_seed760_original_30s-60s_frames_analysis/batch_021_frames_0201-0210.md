Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory mid-screen on the left, travels downwards and to the left, and is intercepted by the paddle. It then rebounds in a steep diagonal path upwards and to the right, strikes the top boundary, and begins a new descent downwards and towards the right side of the playfield.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle, initially on the far left, makes a slight adjustment to the right to position itself for interception.
*   **Images 4-7:** After striking the paddle between frames 3 and 4, the ball's vertical direction is sharply reversed. It now travels at a constant, fast speed upwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary after the successful rebound.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball bounces off the top boundary (the score bar) between frames 7 and 8, again inverting its vertical trajectory. It now proceeds to fall downwards and to the right at a constant speed. Throughout this phase, the paddle stays in its position on the left.
