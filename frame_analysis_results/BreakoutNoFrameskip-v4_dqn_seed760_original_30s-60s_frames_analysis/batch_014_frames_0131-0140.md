Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its descent from the top-right of the screen, moving downwards and to the left. It ricochets off an orange brick, reversing its horizontal direction to travel down and to the right. It then strikes a red brick, which again reverses its horizontal path, sending it on a final trajectory downwards and to the left towards the paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left from its starting position. In Image 2, it makes contact with the rightmost orange brick. This collision is confirmed by the score changing from 216 to 223. The paddle is stationary.
*   **Images 2-5:** After destroying the orange brick (which is gone in Image 3), the ball's trajectory reverses. It now travels downwards and to the right, maintaining a steady speed. In Image 5, it collides with a red brick. The paddle remains motionless during this phase.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball ricochets off the red brick (which disappears in Image 6), causing its horizontal direction to reverse for a second time. It now begins moving downwards and to the left. The paddle makes a small adjustment to the left to better align with the ball's new path.
*   **Images 6-10:** The ball continues on its final, uninterrupted trajectory downwards and to the left at a constant speed. The paddle holds its new position, perfectly aligned to intercept the ball just after the final frame.
