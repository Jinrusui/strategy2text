Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey on the left side of the screen, moving diagonally downwards. It strikes the right edge of the paddle, causing it to rebound in a sharp "V" pattern upwards and to the right. The ball then travels across the screen to strike a blue brick in the upper-right section, before starting another descent downwards and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary on the bottom left, positioned for the upcoming interception.
*   **Image 6:** The ball makes contact with the right side of the paddle.
*   **Images 7-8:** After rebounding off the paddle, the ball's trajectory is reversed. It now travels at a consistent speed upwards and to the right, heading towards the rows of bricks. The paddle does not move.
*   **Image 9:** The ball strikes a dark blue brick on the right-hand side of the formation. A small particle effect appears, indicating the brick has been destroyed.
*   **Image 10:** The ball has rebounded off the brick and is now moving downwards and to the right. The score updates from 053 to 057, confirming the hit. The paddle has made a small adjustment, moving slightly to the left.
