Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The sequence depicts two separate ball trajectories. The first ball travels from the upper-left region diagonally down and to the right, passing the stationary paddle and exiting at the bottom of the screen, which results in a lost life. A new ball is then served from the upper-center, which travels downwards and to the right, successfully striking the right edge of the paddle at the end of the sequence.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The first ball travels at a constant velocity downwards and to the right. The paddle remains completely stationary on the far right side of the screen, making no attempt to move towards the ball.
*   **Image 6:** The first ball has gone past the paddle and off-screen. This is confirmed by the score changing from `313 5 1` to `313 4 1`, indicating one life has been lost. A new ball appears in the upper-middle section of the playfield to begin the next turn.
*   **Images 7-9:** The newly served ball moves at a steady pace downwards and to the right, on a direct course to intercept the paddle, which is still positioned on the far right.
*   **Image 10:** The ball makes contact with the right side of the paddle. Its trajectory is instantly altered, causing it to rebound sharply upwards and to the left.
