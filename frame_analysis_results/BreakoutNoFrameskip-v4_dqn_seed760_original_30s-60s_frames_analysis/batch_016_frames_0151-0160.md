Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins at the top right, just beneath the wall of bricks. It travels in a steep, zig-zagging path downwards as it carves a channel through the center of the bricks. After breaking four bricks in quick succession, it emerges at the bottom of the brick formation and continues its descent towards the bottom-left of the screen, where the paddle is moving to intercept it.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball descends from the top right, moving downwards and to the left at a steep angle. The paddle is stationary on the far left.
*   **Image 3:** The ball makes its first contact, striking an upper-row red brick. This is confirmed by the score changing from 244 to 251. The ball's trajectory continues downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 4-5:** Almost immediately, the ball hits a second red brick directly below the first. The score increases to 258. This impact reverses the ball's horizontal direction, causing it to rebound downwards and to the right.
*   **Image 6:** The ball travels a very short distance before striking a third red brick to its left. The score increases to 265. The ball's direction is again reversed, sending it downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 7-8:** Continuing its descent, the ball hits a fourth brickâ€”this time an orange one. The score increases from 265 to 269. The ball rebounds, maintaining its downward and leftward trajectory.
*   **Images 9-10:** Now clear of the brick wall, the ball falls unimpeded towards the bottom-left. In response to the ball's final trajectory, the paddle, which had been drifting right, changes direction and moves left to position itself for the catch.
