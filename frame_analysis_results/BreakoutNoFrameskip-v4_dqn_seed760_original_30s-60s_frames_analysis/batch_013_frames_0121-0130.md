Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates at the top-right of the playfield, travels in a straight diagonal line downwards and to the left, and is intercepted by the paddle, which moves from the right to the left to meet it. Upon impact, the ball rebounds upwards and to the left, strikes an orange brick, and then begins a new descent downwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball first appears at the top-right of the screen, starting a path downwards and to the left. The paddle is initially positioned on the far right.
*   **Images 2-6:** The ball maintains a constant speed and a straight trajectory, moving diagonally down and to the left. In anticipation, the paddle begins a smooth, continuous movement from the right side of the screen to the left.
*   **Images 6-7:** The interception occurs between these frames. In Image 6, the ball is immediately above the moving paddle. In Image 7, the ball has successfully bounced off the paddle and its direction is now reversed to upwards and to the left.
*   **Images 7-9:** Following the rebound, the ball travels upwards and to the left. Between Image 8 and Image 9, it collides with and destroys an orange brick in the second row. The ball is momentarily obscured at the point of impact in Image 9.
*   **Image 10:** After destroying the brick, the ball reappears, having changed its trajectory again. It is now moving downwards and to the left, while the paddle remains stationary, positioned to receive it.
