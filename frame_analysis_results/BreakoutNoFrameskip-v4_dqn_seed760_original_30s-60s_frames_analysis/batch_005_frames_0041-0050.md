Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the upper-left quadrant and travels diagonally down and to the right. It strikes a green brick, causing it to rebound upwards and to the right until it collides with the ceiling. After bouncing off the ceiling, it reverses its vertical direction and begins descending diagonally down and to the right, ending the sequence in the upper-middle section of the screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the right. Between images 2 and 3, it collides with a green brick. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom, slightly left of center.
*   **Images 4-6:** Having struck the brick, the ball's trajectory is now upwards and to the right. A gap in the green bricks is visible where the impact occurred. The score updates from 069 to 073 in image 6. The paddle begins a slow, subtle shift to the right.
*   **Images 7-8:** The ball strikes the ceiling between frames 6 and 7, causing it to rebound. Its path is now downwards and to the right. The paddle continues its slow move towards the center of the screen.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues its descent at a consistent speed. The paddle has stopped moving and is now positioned near the center, anticipating the ball's arrival.
