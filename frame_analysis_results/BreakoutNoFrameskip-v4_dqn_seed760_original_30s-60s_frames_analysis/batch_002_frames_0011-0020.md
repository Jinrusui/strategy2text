Excellent. Here is a precise motion analysis of the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory just above the paddle, traveling upwards and to the right. It strikes a blue brick, ricochets off the right wall, and begins descending downwards and to the left. The paddle moves right to intercept the ball. After being struck by the paddle, the ball rebounds sharply upwards and to the right, hitting a green brick before the final frame.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a constant speed upwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary, positioned slightly left of the center. The score is 057.
*   **Image 5:** A collision has occurred between frames 4 and 5. The ball has hit the blue brick, confirmed by the score changing from 057 to 058. It has also ricocheted off the right wall and is now moving downwards and to the left. The paddle is still stationary.
*   **Images 6-9:** The ball continues its steady descent downwards and to the left. In response, the paddle begins moving to the right, positioning itself to intercept the ball's path.
*   **Image 10:** A major event has happened between frames 9 and 10. The paddle successfully intercepted the ball, causing a sharp rebound upwards and to the right. The ball has just struck and destroyed a green brick, causing the score to jump from 058 to 062.
