Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey in the upper-right area of the screen, just below the brick formation. It travels downwards and to the right, striking an orange brick at the far-right edge. The ball then rebounds sharply across the screen, moving downwards and to the left. After striking the left wall, its horizontal direction is reversed, and it continues its descent downwards and to the right, ending its path in the lower-left quadrant.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the right. In Image 3, it collides with a brick in the orange row, causing the score to increase from 084 to 091. In response, the paddle begins moving from the center towards the left.
*   **Images 4-8:** Following the rebound, the ball's trajectory shifts to a steep, consistent path downwards and to the left. It travels across the majority of the screen. The paddle continues its move to the far left and then holds its position in anticipation of the ball's arrival.
*   **Images 8-9:** The ball makes contact with the left side wall, which reverses its horizontal direction. It is now traveling downwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary on the far left.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues moving downwards and to the right. Between these frames, the score inexplicably jumps from 091 to 098, despite the ball not hitting any bricks. The paddle does not move.
