Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its path on the left side of the screen, moving downwards and to the right. It strikes a green brick, causing it to rebound downwards and to the left. The ball then ricochets off the left wall, changes direction back towards the right, and is intercepted by the paddle. This final collision sends the ball on a steep, fast trajectory upwards and to the right, where it collides with a red brick in the top row.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the right, directly towards the leftmost brick in the bottom (green) row. The paddle is stationary near the bottom-center of the screen.
*   **Image 3:** The ball makes contact with and destroys the green brick. Its horizontal momentum is reversed, and it now travels downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 4-7:** The score updates from 124 to 125, confirming the destruction of the green brick. The ball continues its trajectory downwards and to the left at a consistent speed, heading towards the side wall.
*   **Image 8:** The ball strikes the left wall, initiating another change in direction. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Image 9:** Having rebounded off the wall, the ball is now moving downwards and to the right, directly towards the waiting paddle.
*   **Image 10:** The ball has struck the paddle and rebounded sharply upwards and to the right. This powerful rebound sends it directly into a red brick in the top row, destroying it and causing the score to jump from 125 to 132.
