Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates in the lower-left portion of the play area. It travels in a straight diagonal line, moving upwards and to the right until it makes contact with the right-side wall. After ricocheting off the wall, the ball's path is altered to an upward-left trajectory, which it follows until it strikes a green brick in the top-left section of the brick formation.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball moves at a constant speed diagonally upwards and to the right, starting from a low position on the left. The paddle is positioned near the bottom-left corner and remains completely stationary.
*   **Image 6:** The ball makes contact with the right wall, marking the apex of its rightward movement.
*   **Images 7-9:** Having rebounded from the wall, the ball's trajectory is now upwards and to the left. It maintains a steady speed as it travels across the screen toward the bricks. The paddle remains unmoved.
*   **Image 10:** The ball completes its trajectory by striking a green brick in the upper-left section of the wall. At the exact moment of impact, the paddle begins a slight but deliberate movement to the right, likely anticipating the ball's subsequent downward path.
