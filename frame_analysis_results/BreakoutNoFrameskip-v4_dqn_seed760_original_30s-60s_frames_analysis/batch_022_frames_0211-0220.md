Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided images.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory on the upper-right side of the screen, traveling diagonally downwards and to the left. It collides with and destroys a blue brick in the bottom row of the wall. After the collision, it continues its descent towards the left wall, ricochets off it, and reverses its horizontal direction, now moving downwards and to the right towards the paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a constant speed diagonally, descending towards the left side of the screen. The paddle remains completely stationary on the bottom right.
*   **Image 5:** The ball makes direct contact with a blue brick in the lowest tier of the wall.
*   **Images 6-8:** After destroying the brick, the ball continues its path downwards and to the left without changing its angle or speed. The paddle stays in its original position on the right.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball strikes the left wall and immediately rebounds, now traveling downwards and to the right. In anticipation of the ball's new path, the paddle begins moving to the left to position itself for the interception.
