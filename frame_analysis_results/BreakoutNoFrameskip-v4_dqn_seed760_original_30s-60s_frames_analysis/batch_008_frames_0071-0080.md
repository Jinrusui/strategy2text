Of course. Here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory based on the provided image sequence.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:

The ball begins its journey in the middle-left portion of the screen, descending towards the paddle. It is intercepted on the left side of the paddle, causing it to rebound upwards and to the left, where it strikes and destroys a green brick. This collision sends the ball back on a downward-left trajectory, and the sequence concludes as the paddle moves into position to intercept it for a second time in the bottom-left corner.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:

*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady pace downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary, positioned in the bottom-left quadrant, awaiting the ball's arrival.
*   **Image 4:** The ball makes contact with the left portion of the stationary paddle, marking the first major collision in the sequence.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball rebounds sharply upwards and to the left. Between these frames, it strikes a green brick. This is confirmed by the score changing from `098` to `105`. The paddle makes a slight move to the right after the initial rebound.
*   **Images 7-8:** Following the brick collision, the ball's trajectory is now downwards and to the left. The paddle reverses its previous movement and begins shifting left to intercept the ball again.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball continues its descent towards the bottom-left corner. The paddle successfully repositions itself, and the sequence ends at the exact moment the ball makes its second contact with the paddle.
