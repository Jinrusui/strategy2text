You are an AI assistant analyzing a Breakout RL agent's gameplay video for key moments.

Your task is to identify and timestamp the most important strategic and tactical events. Focus on, for example:

1.  **Critical Decision Points**: Moments where the agent makes important strategic choices
2.  **Tactical Errors & Misses**: Significant mistakes, missed opportunities, or clear failures in ball tracking.
3.  **Strategy Changes**: Points where the agent adapts or changes its brick-clearing approach
4.  **Key Successes & Skilled Shots**: Moments of effective play or shots indicating advanced ball control.
5.  **Game State Transitions**: Important changes in game dynamics (e.g., ball speed increase).


**OUTPUT FORMAT**: Return ONLY a JSON list of events with this exact structure:
[
  {
    "timestamp": "MM:SS-MM:SS",
    "event": "Brief description of what happens",
    "type": "critical_decision|tactical_error|strategy_change|key_success|game_transition|skilled_shot"
  }
]

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Provide timestamps in MM:SS-MM:SS format (e.g., "0:15-0:20")
- Keep event descriptions concise (1-2 sentences max)
- Include important events as much as possible
- Return valid JSON format only - no additional text or explanations

You are analyzing a Breakout RL agent's gameplay using only the event descriptions below as your source of information.

**EVENT DESCRIPTIONS:**
{key_events}

**ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**
1. Summarize the sequence of events and the agent's observable actions, and the results of the strategy if good or bad, like number of scores, number of lives lost, etc.
2. Describe any patterns or repeated behaviors that are evident from the events.
3. Highlight clear successes or failures, as described in the events and the results of the strategy.

        return """
You are synthesizing multiple gameplay analyses from different seeds to create a comprehensive evaluation report of a Breakout RL agent.

**ANALYSIS DATA:**
{all_summaries}

Your task is to integrate the information from all seeds into a cohesive, high-level report that references specific videos and time spans throughout. This allows readers to verify insights by watching exact video segments.

Although the same agent may present different performance or behavior in different seeds, use all the information to form an overall assessment. There is no need to artificially balance good and bad aspectsâ€”if the evidence points to the agent being strong or weak overall, state this clearly.

## Critical Requirements for Video References

Throughout your analysis, reference specific videos using the exact format "`seedXXX` at MM:SS-MM:SS".

Examples:
- "`seed0` at 00:15-00:20" (for observations in seed0 video from 15-20 seconds)
- "`seed42` at 00:06-00:14" (for observations in seed42 video from 6-14 seconds)
- "while `seed100` shows tunneling at 00:12-00:15, `seed420` fails defensively at 00:18-00:21"

## Synthesis Framework (Video-Referenced)

1. Executive Summary  
   Provide a 2-3 sentence overview of the agent's overall competence, referencing specific examples with video IDs and timestamps.

2. Strategic Analysis  
   Analyze the agent's core strategies across episodes, citing specific video evidence:
   - Primary approaches and their results, with video examples.
   - Consistency or variation in strategy execution across seeds.
   - Adaptation to game state, with supporting references.

3. Tactical Skill Assessment  
   Evaluate paddle control and reaction skills with precise references:
   - Offensive and defensive skills, with supporting video/timestamp examples.
   - Consistency and variation across seeds.

4. Performance Differentiators  
   Identify what separates high vs. low performance episodes:
   - Behaviors leading to success or failure, with specific references.
   - Critical decision points, using video/timestamp citations.

5. Failure Mode Analysis if detected  
   Categorize and reference specific failure patterns:
   - Recurring or situational mistakes, with video evidence.
   - Recovery patterns, with supporting moments.

**Length**: Keep the report concise but comprehensive (400-600 words).
**Focus**: Prioritize insights that can be verified through specific video references.
**Structure**: Use clear section headers and maintain logical flow from general to specific observations.
