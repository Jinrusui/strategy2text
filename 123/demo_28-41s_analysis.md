## Technical RL Policy Analysis

**Technical Analysis of Agent Policy**

The agent demonstrates a highly effective and well-established policy for the game *Breakout*.

*   **0-7s: Tunneling Strategy Execution:** The agent's policy is immediately apparent. It consistently intercepts the projectile on the left side of its paddle, imparting a sharp angle that directs it to the far-left column of bricks. This repeated action is a deliberate "tunneling" strategy, designed to create a vertical channel through the brick wall. The control is precise and optimized for this single goal.

*   **7-13s: Adaptive Waiting Policy:** After successfully creating a channel at the 7-second mark, the agentâ€™s policy shifts. The projectile becomes trapped in the upper region, bouncing between the top wall and the remaining bricks, scoring points automatically. The agent correctly identifies this state and transitions to a patient, anticipatory policy. It preemptively moves the paddle to the right half of the screen and ceases movement, correctly predicting the projectile's eventual exit path.

There are no control errors in this clip. The policy execution is flawless, showcasing a sophisticated, multi-stage strategy that transitions from aggressive, targeted action to predictive waiting.
