# Batch 2: Frames 0011-0020

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins mid-screen on the right side, traveling diagonally downwards. It is intercepted by the paddle on the bottom right, causing it to rebound diagonally upwards and to the left. Its ascent is stopped when it collides with and destroys a blue brick, reversing its vertical direction to travel downwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary on the bottom-right side of the screen, positioned to intercept the ball.
*   **Image 5:** The ball makes contact with the right half of the paddle.
*   **Images 6-8:** Following the rebound, the ball's trajectory shifts. It now travels at a steady speed upwards and to the left, heading directly for the wall of bricks. The paddle remains completely stationary after the interception.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball strikes a blue brick, causing the brick to disappear and the score to update from 006 to 007. This collision reverses the ball's vertical momentum, and it begins moving downwards and to the left. The paddle has not moved throughout the entire sequence.
