# Batch 5: Frames 0041-0050

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the upper-middle-left portion of the screen, just below the bricks. It travels in a straight diagonal line downwards and to the left, strikes the left wall, and then rebounds. It then travels across the entire width of the screen in a straight diagonal line downwards and to the right, ultimately striking the right wall near the bottom of the play area.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle is completely stationary, positioned towards the center-right of the screen.
*   **Image 3:** The ball makes contact with the left wall, causing it to rebound.
*   **Images 4-9:** Following the rebound, the ball's trajectory is now downwards and to the right. It maintains a constant speed as it traverses the screen, passing over the stationary paddle.
*   **Image 10:** The ball's journey across the screen concludes as it makes contact with the right wall. The paddle has not moved at all during this entire sequence.
