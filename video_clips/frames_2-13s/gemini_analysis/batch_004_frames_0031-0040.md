# Batch 4: Frames 0031-0040

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball travels in a straight diagonal line from the upper-left portion of the screen, moving consistently downwards and to the right. Its path is aimed directly at the lower-right corner of the playing area where the paddle is moving to intercept it.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball starts its descent from below the blue bricks, moving at a constant speed downwards and to the right. In anticipation, the paddle, initially positioned near the center, begins a deliberate and steady movement to the right.
*   **Images 5-7:** The ball continues on its unchanging linear path without any change in speed. The paddle maintains its consistent rightward velocity, tracking the ball's horizontal position.
*   **Images 8-10:** In the final phase of its descent, the ball nears the right wall. The paddle reaches the far-right edge of the screen and becomes stationary, perfectly positioned to intercept the incoming ball. The sequence concludes with the ball just moments away from making contact with the paddle or the wall.
