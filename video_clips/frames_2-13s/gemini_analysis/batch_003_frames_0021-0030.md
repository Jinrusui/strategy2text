# Batch 3: Frames 0021-0030


### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its descent from the upper-middle section of the playfield, moving diagonally downwards and to the right. It strikes the right wall, causing it to rebound and change its horizontal direction. The ball then continues its descent towards the bottom-left, where the paddle moves from its initial position to successfully intercept it, causing the ball to rebound upwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball travels at a constant speed in a straight diagonal line, moving downwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom, positioned slightly to the right of the center.
*   **Image 5:** The ball makes contact with the right wall. This impact reverses its horizontal movement, and it begins traveling downwards and to the left. The paddle has not yet moved.
*   **Images 6-8:** The ball continues its new trajectory downwards and to the left at a steady speed. In response, the paddle begins a controlled slide to the left to position itself for the interception.
*   **Images 9-10:** The paddle successfully intercepts the ball. In Image 9, the ball makes contact, and in Image 10, it sharply rebounds. Its vertical direction is now reversed, sending it traveling upwards and to the left, away from the paddle.
