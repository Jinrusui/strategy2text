# Batch 1: Frames 0001-0010

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey in the upper-middle section of the playfield, descending at a steady angle towards the right. The paddle, anticipating the ball's path, moves from the center to the right side of the screen. After successfully intercepting the ball near the bottom-right corner, the paddle causes it to rebound sharply, sending it on a new trajectory upwards and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** Having just broken a blue brick (as indicated by the score changing from 4 to 5), the ball travels at a moderate speed downwards and to the right. The paddle, which was near the center, begins moving to the right.
*   **Images 3-6:** The ball maintains its constant downward and rightward trajectory. In response, the paddle continues its smooth, anticipatory slide to the right, perfectly aligning itself for the incoming ball.
*   **Image 7:** The ball makes contact with the right edge of the paddle. The paddle's successful interception completely halts the ball's downward motion.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball rebounds off the paddle and begins a new path, moving upwards and to the right. While the ball travels away, the paddle reverses its direction and starts moving back toward the left, repositioning for the next volley.
