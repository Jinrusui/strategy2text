# Batch 6: Frames 0051-0060

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its path in the lower-right quadrant, descending towards the paddle. It strikes the paddle and rebounds sharply, traveling on a long, steep trajectory upwards and to the left. After crossing the playfield, the ball collides with the left wall and begins to fall back down and to the right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves downwards and to the right, heading directly for the paddle, which is positioned on the right side of the screen.
*   **Image 3:** The ball makes contact with the right half of the stationary paddle, initiating a rebound.
*   **Images 4-7:** The ball travels at a consistent, fast speed upwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary through Image 6, then begins moving left in Image 7 in anticipation of the ball's return.
*   **Image 8:** The ball collides with the left wall, causing it to change direction. The paddle continues its leftward movement.
*   **Images 9-10:** Having bounced off the wall, the ball now moves downwards and to the right. The paddle is still moving left, positioning itself away from the ball's new path.
