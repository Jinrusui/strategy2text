# Batch 7: Frames 0061-0070

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the upper-middle portion of the screen, having just broken a brick. It travels in a straight diagonal line downwards and to the left, where it strikes the edge of the paddle. The ball then rebounds sharply upwards and to the left, ricochets off the side wall, and begins another descent towards the left side of the playfield.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball travels at a steady speed on a clear diagonal path, moving downwards and to the left. The paddle remains completely stationary, positioned towards the center-left, awaiting the ball's arrival. Notably, the score changes from 009 to 010 between the first and second images, indicating a brick was hit immediately before this sequence started.
*   **Images 5-6:** The ball makes contact with the far-left edge of the stationary paddle.
*   **Images 6-8:** After striking the paddle, the ball rebounds sharply upwards and to the left at a steep angle, maintaining its speed. The paddle does not move.
*   **Images 8-9:** The ball's upward trajectory concludes as it collides with the left wall.
*   **Images 9-10:** The ball ricochets off the wall, reversing its horizontal direction. It now moves downwards and to the left, once again heading towards the stationary paddle.
