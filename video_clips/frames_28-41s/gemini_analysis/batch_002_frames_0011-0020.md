# Batch 2: Frames 0011-0020

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the upper-left quadrant of the playfield, moving downwards and to the left. It strikes a blue brick, causing its path to reverse horizontally. The ball then travels downwards and to the right across the screen, where it is successfully intercepted by the paddle, which has moved from the center to the far left to meet it.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a steady speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary near the bottom-center of the screen.
*   **Images 3-4:** The ball collides with the leftmost blue brick, destroying it. This collision immediately reverses the ball's horizontal direction, and it begins moving downwards and to the right.
*   **Image 5:** The score updates from 041 to 045, registering the points from the destroyed brick. The ball continues on its new path. In response, the paddle begins a deliberate movement to the left to intercept the ball.
*   **Images 6-9:** The ball maintains a consistent speed and angle, continuing its descent towards the bottom-left. The paddle also moves steadily to the left, precisely positioning itself under the ball's anticipated point of impact.
*   **Images 9-10:** The paddle successfully intercepts the ball on the far left side of the screen. The ball makes contact and rebounds sharply, beginning a new trajectory upwards and to the right.
