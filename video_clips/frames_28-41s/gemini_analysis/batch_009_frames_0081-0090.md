# Batch 9: Frames 0081-0090

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball's visible trajectory begins at the top-left of the screen, moving downwards. It ricochets off the left wall, reversing its horizontal direction to travel down and to the right. It then strikes a brick, causing it to rebound upwards and to the right. Finally, it hits the right wall and begins a new descent downwards and to the right, striking several more bricks before the sequence ends.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Image 1:** The ball is not visible. The paddle is stationary at the bottom, positioned left of center.
*   **Images 2-3:** The ball appears in the upper-left quadrant, having just struck a red brick. It travels at a constant speed downwards and to the left, striking a second red brick. The paddle does not move.
*   **Image 4:** The ball collides with the left wall, causing a sharp rebound. Its trajectory is now downwards and to the right. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Image 5:** Continuing its path, the ball strikes a red brick, which reverses its vertical direction. The ball now moves upwards and to the right.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball continues its upward path, striking another red brick before hitting the right wall. The collision with the wall reverses its horizontal direction, and it begins moving downwards and to the right. The paddle makes a very slight adjustment to the left.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball proceeds on a steady path downwards and to the right, consecutively striking two more red bricks. The paddle makes one final, minor shift to the left near the end of the sequence.
