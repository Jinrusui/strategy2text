# Batch 8: Frames 0071-0080


### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins at the top-center of the screen, travels downwards and to the right, and strikes the outer red bricks. It then rebounds sharply, moving downwards and to the left across the screen, breaking several more bricks in its path. After hitting the left wall, it bounces off and proceeds downwards and to the right, heading towards the paddle which has moved left to intercept it.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball descends from the top of the screen at a steady speed, moving downwards and to the right. It makes contact with the rightmost red brick. The paddle is stationary on the far-right side of the screen.
*   **Images 3-5:** Upon striking the red brick (and a second one almost immediately), the ball's trajectory reverses. It now moves downwards and to the left, hitting an orange brick. The paddle remains stationary.
*   **Images 5-8:** The ball continues steadily on its downward-left path, breaking another orange brick and then a yellow one. In response to the ball's new direction, the paddle begins to move from the right side of the screen towards the left.
*   **Image 8-9:** The ball makes contact with the left wall and rebounds, changing its direction to downwards and to the right.
*   **Image 9-10:** Continuing its descent after the wall bounce, the ball hits another yellow brick. The paddle has successfully anticipated this trajectory and is now positioned on the left side, waiting to intercept the ball.
