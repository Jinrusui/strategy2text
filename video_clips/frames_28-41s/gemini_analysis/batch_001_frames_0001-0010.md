# Batch 1: Frames 0001-0010

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the upper-right area of the screen, having just broken a brick. It travels diagonally downwards and to the left towards the paddle. The paddle moves to the far left to intercept the ball, causing it to rebound sharply upwards and to the right. The ball then travels back across the screen until it strikes and destroys a yellow brick in the upper-right quadrant.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary, positioned slightly left of the center.
*   **Images 4-6:** The ball continues its steady descent. In response, the paddle begins moving deliberately to the left to position itself for an interception.
*   **Images 7-8:** As the ball nears the bottom of the screen, the paddle completes its movement, stopping at the far-left edge of the play area in anticipation of the ball's arrival.
*   **Image 9:** The paddle successfully intercepts the ball. The ball's trajectory is instantly reversed, and it now travels upwards and to the right at a consistent speed.
*   **Image 10:** The ball collides with a yellow brick in the upper right. The brick is destroyed (indicated by the score changing from 034 to 041), and the ball is seen just below the newly created gap, its upward momentum stopped.
