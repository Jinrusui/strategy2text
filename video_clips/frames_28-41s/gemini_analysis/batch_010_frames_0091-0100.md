# Batch 10: Frames 0091-0100

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins in the upper-left quadrant and moves downwards, striking a series of bricks. Its path consists of multiple ricochets: first off a brick, then off the ceiling, and finally off the right-side wall. This sequence of collisions clears five bricks and redirects the ball from an initial downward-right path to a final downward-left path, ending in the upper-right section of the playfield.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball travels downwards and to the right from its starting position. It strikes the leftmost red brick, causing the brick to disappear. The ball rebounds sharply upwards and to the right. The paddle is not involved in this interaction.
*   **Images 4-5:** Continuing its upward-right trajectory, the ball strikes a second red brick and then immediately collides with the ceiling.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball rebounds off the ceiling, now moving downwards and to the right. It immediately hits and clears a third red brick on its new path.
*   **Images 7-8:** The ball continues its descent towards the right wall. Just before impact, it strikes and clears the rightmost orange brick in the top row.
*   **Images 9-10:** After hitting the right wall, the ball's trajectory inverts to downwards and to the left. As it travels, it hits and clears a fifth brick (another orange one), continuing on its new downward-left path.
