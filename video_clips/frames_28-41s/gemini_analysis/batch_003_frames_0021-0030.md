# Batch 3: Frames 0021-0030

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its path just above the paddle in the lower-center of the screen. It travels in a straight diagonal line upwards and to the right until it collides with the rightmost yellow brick. Upon impact, it rebounds and begins descending diagonally downwards and to the right, heading back towards the stationary paddle.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-5:** The ball travels at a constant speed diagonally upwards and to the right. It moves from its starting position towards the right side of the brick wall. The paddle remains completely stationary at the bottom-center of the screen.
*   **Image 6:** The ball makes contact with and breaks the yellow brick on the far right. This impact causes an immediate change in the ball's trajectory and the score increases from 049 to 056.
*   **Images 7-10:** Following the rebound from the brick, the ball now moves at a constant speed diagonally downwards and to the right. It continues on this new path, heading back towards the paddle, which has not moved during the entire sequence.
