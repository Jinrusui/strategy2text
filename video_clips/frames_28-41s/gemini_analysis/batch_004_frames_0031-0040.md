# Batch 4: Frames 0031-0040

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins high in the playfield, moving diagonally downwards and to the right. It is intercepted by the paddle near the bottom-right, causing a sharp rebound upwards and to the right. The ball then strikes a green brick, which inverts its vertical trajectory, sending it downwards and to the right once more.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-6:** The ball travels at a steady speed diagonally downwards and to the right. The score increases from 056 to 057 between the first two frames, indicating a blue brick was broken just before this sequence began. In anticipation, the paddle drifts deliberately to the right from its central position to align with the ball's path.
*   **Images 7-8:** The ball strikes the right side of the paddle and rebounds quickly upwards and to the right. It travels a short distance before immediately striking a green brick. This impact is confirmed by the score jumping from 057 to 061.
*   **Images 9-10:** Having bounced off the green brick, the ball's trajectory is now downwards and to the right again. The paddle has already begun a slight corrective movement back towards the left to prepare for the ball's return.
