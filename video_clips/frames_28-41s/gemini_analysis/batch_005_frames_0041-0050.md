# Batch 5: Frames 0041-0050


### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey on the left side of the play area, traveling in a consistent downward and rightward diagonal path. After striking the right wall, it rebounds downwards and to the left. The paddle, positioned in the lower-center, intercepts the ball, causing a steep and rapid rebound upwards and to the right. The ball then strikes a red brick in the top row and begins a new descent.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves steadily downwards and to the right. Between images 2 and 3, it collides with and destroys a blue brick, causing the score to change from 061 to 065. The paddle moves from the bottom-left towards the center.
*   **Images 4-7:** The ball continues its trajectory downwards and to the right at a constant speed. The paddle has positioned itself near the center and remains stationary, anticipating the ball's path after it hits the wall.
*   **Image 8:** Between frames 7 and 8, the ball strikes the right wall. Its trajectory has now inverted, and it is moving downwards and to the left, directly towards the waiting paddle.
*   **Image 9:** The paddle has successfully intercepted the ball between frames. This has resulted in a sharp, high-speed rebound. The ball is now a single white pixel at the very top-right of the screen, traveling upwards towards the bricks.
*   **Image 10:** The ball has struck a red brick on the far right of the top row, causing the score to increase from 065 to 072. The ball is now rebounding from this collision and has begun moving downwards again.
