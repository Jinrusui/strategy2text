# Final Frame Analysis Report


The agent demonstrates a highly effective and methodical approach to playing Breakout. Initially, it employs simple, deliberate paddle movements to clear lower-level bricks from both sides of the screen. The agent’s playstyle quickly evolves from reactive saves to proactive setups.

The key to its success lies in two highly efficient sequences. Midway through the clip, the agent sets up a predictable downward trajectory for the ball, allowing it to systematically destroy an entire column of bricks while the paddle waits patiently. In the final segments, the agent executes a masterful series of ricochets, using the walls and ceiling to trap the ball in the upper playfield. This maneuver results in clearing numerous high-value red bricks in rapid succession. The agent’s performance is defined by precise paddle control and the ability to create and exploit complex, multi-brick combinations to clear the board efficiently.
