# Batch 6: Frames 0051-0060

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory near the top-center of the screen, moving downwards and to the left. After striking a single brick on the top row, its path is reversed into a long, steady diagonal descent towards the bottom-right. It systematically clears a column of bricks from the top two rows before ending the sequence still in motion, heading towards the paddle which has repositioned itself on the far right.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-center of the playfield.
*   **Images 2-3:** The ball strikes a red brick on the top row. This collision reverses its horizontal momentum, and it begins moving downwards and to the right.
*   **Image 4:** This frame is identical to the previous one, showing no new movement.
*   **Images 5-8:** The ball continues on a consistent diagonal path downwards and to the right, striking and destroying a new brick in each frame (three red, one orange). In response to the ball's new, predictable trajectory, the paddle begins a smooth movement to the right.
*   **Image 9:** This is another static frame, identical to the previous one, with no change in the ball or paddle position.
*   **Image 10:** The ball hits one more orange brick, maintaining its speed and downward-right trajectory. The paddle has now completed its movement and is positioned at the far right edge of the screen, ready to intercept the ball.
