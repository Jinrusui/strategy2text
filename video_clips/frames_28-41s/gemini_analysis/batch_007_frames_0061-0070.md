# Batch 7: Frames 0061-0070

### Overall Trajectory Summary:

The ball begins its trajectory at the top-left of the play area, travels downwards and left to strike the side wall, and then rebounds diagonally down towards the bottom-right. It is intercepted by the paddle, which deflects it on a steep path upwards and to the left. The ball then collides with and destroys two adjacent red bricks in the top row before beginning its descent again as the sequence ends.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:

*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left. In Image 3, it collides with the left wall. The paddle remains stationary on the far right.
*   **Images 4-6:** After rebounding off the wall, the ball's trajectory is now downwards and to the right. It maintains a consistent speed as it travels across the screen towards the paddle.
*   **Image 7:** The ball makes contact with the right side of the stationary paddle and rebounds sharply. Its direction is now upwards and to the left.
*   **Images 8-9:** The ball travels steadily upwards. Between these frames, it collides with a red brick in the top row, causing the brick to disappear and the score to increase by 7 points (from 160 to 167).
*   **Image 10:** After the impact in the previous frame, the ball rebounds and immediately strikes the adjacent red brick. This second brick disappears, the score again increases by 7 points (from 167 to 174), and the ball's final trajectory is altered to downwards and to the left.
