# Batch 5: Frames 0041-0050


### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory mid-screen, traveling downwards and towards the right wall. Upon striking the wall, it ricochets and travels diagonally downwards and to the left. The ball traverses the lower half of the playfield on this path until it is successfully intercepted by the paddle, which has moved to the bottom-left. The impact rebounds the ball on a new trajectory, upwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball travels at a constant, moderate speed in a straight line, moving downwards and to the right. The paddle is stationary, positioned towards the center-left of the screen's bottom edge.
*   **Images 4-5:** Between Image 3 and Image 4, the ball collides with the right wall. Its trajectory immediately reverses horizontally, and it now proceeds downwards and to the left at a consistent speed. The paddle remains stationary, with the player seemingly waiting for the ball to approach.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball continues its descent. The paddle is now in motion, moving deliberately to the left to align with the ball's predicted point of contact.
*   **Images 8-10:** Between Image 7 and Image 8, the paddle successfully intercepts the ball. This causes a sharp rebound, sending the ball on a new trajectory upwards and to the left. The paddle ceases its movement, coming to a rest at the point of impact near the bottom-left corner.
