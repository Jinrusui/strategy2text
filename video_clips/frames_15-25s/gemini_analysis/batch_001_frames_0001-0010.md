# Batch 1: Frames 0001-0010

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its journey just above the paddle in the lower-center of the screen. It travels in a straight line, moving upwards and to the right, until it collides with a blue brick. Following the impact, the ball rebounds and begins a new trajectory, moving downwards and to the right, ending the sequence mid-screen.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball travels at a constant speed upwards and to the right, heading directly for a gap in the blue bricks. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom of the screen.
*   **Image 5:** The ball strikes the bottom-right corner of a blue brick, marking the moment of impact.
*   **Images 6-10:** After rebounding off the brick, the ball's vertical direction is reversed. It now travels at a constant speed downwards and to the right. The paddle stays in its original position and makes no move to intercept the ball on its new path.
