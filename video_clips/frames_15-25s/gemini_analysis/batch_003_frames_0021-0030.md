# Batch 3: Frames 0021-0030


Based on the sequence of images provided, here is a precise motion analysis of the ball's trajectory. The sequence consists of two distinct states: the first state is shown in Images 1-3, and the second state is shown in Images 4-10.

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The sequence captures a single, discrete moment of gameplay. The ball, having been traveling upwards and to the right, strikes a blue brick on the right side of the wall. After destroying the brick, the ball rebounds and begins a new, very short trajectory downwards and to the right, as seen in the transition from the first set of images to the second.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** These three images are identical and represent the first state. The ball is seen moving upwards and to the right, just about to make contact with a blue brick. The paddle is positioned near the center-right of the screen and is stationary. The score is 013.

*   **Transition (Between Image 3 and 4):** The key event of the sequence occurs. The ball strikes and eliminates the blue brick on the far right. This impact causes two changes: the score increments from 013 to 014, and the ball's vertical direction is reversed.

*   **Images 4-10:** These seven images are identical and show the second state, immediately after the impact. The ball is now moving downwards and to the right. The paddle has not moved and remains in its fixed position, awaiting the ball's descent.
