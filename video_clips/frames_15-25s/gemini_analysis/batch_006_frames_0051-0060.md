# Batch 6: Frames 0051-0060

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its ascent from just above the centrally-located paddle, traveling upwards and slightly to the left. It strikes and destroys a blue brick, then reverses its course, descending downwards and to the left for the rest of the sequence, moving towards the left wall.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves steadily upwards and to the left, approaching the layer of blue bricks. The paddle remains stationary at the bottom-center of the playfield.
*   **Images 4-5:** The ball makes contact with a blue brick on the left side. Upon impact in Image 4, the brick is destroyed (disappearing in Image 5), and the ball's trajectory is reversed. It now begins moving downwards and to the left.
*   **Images 6-9:** The ball continues on its new downward-left path at a constant speed. The paddle does not move from its initial central position.
*   **Image 10:** The ball continues its descent. The score updates from 17 to 18, registering the point for the brick destroyed in the previous frames. The paddle remains stationary and is not positioned to intercept the ball.
