# Batch 8: Frames 0071-0080

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory in the upper-left quadrant, moving downwards towards the left. It collides with a blue brick, causing it to rebound and travel in a diagonal path downwards and to the right, moving across the screen towards the right wall by the end of the sequence.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-4:** The ball travels at a consistent speed downwards and to the left. The paddle remains stationary in the bottom-center of the playfield.
*   **Image 5:** The ball makes contact with a blue brick located in the lower-left section of the brick formation.
*   **Images 6-7:** Having just struck the brick, the ball's trajectory has sharply reversed horizontally. It now moves steadily downwards and to the right. The score updates from "018" to "019" to reflect the broken brick.
*   **Images 8-10:** The ball continues on its new, consistent path downwards and to the right, progressing across the screen and nearing the right wall. The paddle does not move throughout this entire sequence.
