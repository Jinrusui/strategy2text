# Batch 4: Frames 0031-0040


### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its trajectory near the top right, just below the blue row of bricks. It travels at a consistent diagonal angle downwards and to the left across the screen. It is intercepted by the paddle, which is positioned towards the center-right. The ball then rebounds sharply upwards and to the right, striking another blue brick on the right side of the formation.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-2:** The ball appears just after hitting a brick (the score changes from 014 to 015 between these frames). It begins moving downwards and to the left. The paddle is stationary, positioned near the center-right.
*   **Images 3-8:** The ball continues its descent at a steady, constant speed along a straight diagonal path. During this entire phase, the paddle remains completely still, perfectly positioned to intercept the incoming ball.
*   **Image 9:** The ball makes contact with the stationary paddle and rebounds. Its trajectory immediately reverses, and it begins traveling upwards and to the right.
*   **Image 10:** The ball continues its new upward trajectory at a constant speed, colliding with a blue brick on the right. The score updates from 015 to 016, confirming the successful hit.
