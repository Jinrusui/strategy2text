# Batch 2: Frames 0011-0020


### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball originates in the upper playfield, just below the bricks, and travels downwards and to the left. It ricochets off the left wall, reversing its horizontal direction to move downwards and to the right. The paddle moves from the left to intercept the ball, causing a final rebound upwards and to the left.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-6:** The ball travels at a steady speed downwards and to the left, heading directly for the side wall. The paddle is stationary at the bottom-left.
*   **Images 6-7:** The ball strikes the left wall, causing an immediate change in its horizontal direction.
*   **Images 7-9:** Now rebounding, the ball moves downwards and to the right. The paddle anticipates this path and begins moving smoothly to the right to position itself for the block.
*   **Images 9-10:** The paddle successfully intercepts the ball. The impact causes a sharp rebound, sending the ball back up into the playfield on an upwards and leftwards trajectory.
