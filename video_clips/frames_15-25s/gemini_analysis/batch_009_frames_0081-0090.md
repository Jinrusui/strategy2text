# Batch 9: Frames 0081-0090

### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its path in the lower right, travels diagonally upwards and to the left to strike a blue brick. It then rebounds downwards and to the left, collides with the left wall, and finally travels diagonally downwards and to the right, heading towards the paddle which has repositioned itself on the far left for interception.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed upwards and to the left. It strikes a blue brick in the bottom row. Concurrently, the paddle begins moving from the right side of the screen towards the left.
*   **Images 3-6:** After striking the brick, the ball's direction reverses. It now travels downwards and to the left at a steady speed. In Image 6, it makes contact with the left wall. The paddle continues its smooth movement to the left to get into position.
*   **Images 6-10:** Rebounding off the left wall, the ball changes direction again, now moving downwards and to the right. It maintains its speed as it descends. The paddle has reached the far-left side of the screen and remains stationary, perfectly positioned to intercept the incoming ball.
