# Batch 7: Frames 0061-0070


### Overall Trajectory Summary:
The ball begins its path on the left side of the playfield, travels downwards to strike the left wall, and then ricochets into a long diagonal trajectory downwards and to the right. The paddle, initially positioned on the far left, moves swiftly across the screen to the right to successfully intercept the ball just before it hits the bottom.

### Detailed Motion Breakdown:
*   **Images 1-3:** The ball moves at a constant speed downwards and to the left, striking the left wall in Image 3. The paddle is stationary at the bottom-left of the screen.
*   **Images 4-6:** Having bounced off the wall, the ball's horizontal direction is reversed. It now travels steadily downwards and to the right, moving away from the paddle's initial position.
*   **Images 7-8:** The ball continues its consistent descent toward the bottom-right. The player initiates a rapid move, sliding the paddle from the left side of the screen towards the right to intercept.
*   **Images 9-10:** The paddle arrives in position just in time. The ball strikes the right side of the paddle and rebounds, changing its trajectory to move upwards and to the right.
