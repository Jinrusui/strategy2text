## Technical RL Policy Analysis

**Technical Analysis of Agent Policy**

**Key Moments & Strategy:**

*   **00:00-00:07:** The agent exhibits a sophisticated "tunneling" strategy. It intentionally strikes the projectile with the right edge of the platform, consistently directing it at a sharp angle into the top-left corner. This allows the projectile to get trapped behind the main wall of objects, where it can destroy them rapidly without further agent intervention. This is a highly efficient, non-obvious strategy.
*   **00:07-00:13:** Once the projectile is "tunneling," the agent's policy shifts to a waiting state. It preemptively moves the platform to the far right and holds its position. This indicates the policy has learned to anticipate the projectile's eventual exit point from the top of the screen.

**Control Errors:**

*   No control errors are observed. The agent executes its plan flawlessly within the clip.

**Policy Observation:**

The agentâ€™s policy is not merely reactive. It demonstrates a clear, multi-stage strategic plan: actively create a tunnel, then patiently wait while positioning for the next phase of play. This behavior shows a deep understanding of the game's physics and scoring mechanics, prioritizing long-term gain over simple, continuous interception.
