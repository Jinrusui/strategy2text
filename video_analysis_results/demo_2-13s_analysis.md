## Technical RL Policy Analysis

Based on the provided clip, here is a technical analysis of the agent's policy execution.

The agent's policy demonstrates a foundational but flawed control strategy.

**Key Moments & Analysis:**

*   **00:02 - 00:03:** The agent successfully executes its first interception. The policy correctly maps the initial state (ball trajectory) to the action (minor rightward paddle adjustment), showing a basic capability.

*   **00:09 - 00:10 (Control Error):** A critical failure occurs, resulting in the loss of a life. The agent’s platform is positioned too far to the right as the projectile descends along the left wall. The policy fails to command a sufficient or timely move to the left to intercept the projectile.

**Policy Observation:**

The failure at 00:10 highlights a significant weakness. The agent’s lack of a decisive response suggests the policy is undertrained for trajectories aimed at the outer edges of the play area. It may be overly biased towards maintaining a central position, leading to fatal hesitation when a large, quick movement is required. This specific failure mode indicates a gap in the agent's learned state-action mapping for this scenario.
