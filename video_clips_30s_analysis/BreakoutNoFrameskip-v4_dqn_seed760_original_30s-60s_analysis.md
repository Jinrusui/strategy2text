## Technical RL Policy Analysis

**Technical Analysis of Agent Policy**

**Key Moments & Policy Formation:**

*   **00:11-00:17:** The agent exhibits a sophisticated, high-reward strategy. It deliberately maneuvers the platform to direct the projectile into a "tunnel" on the far left. The projectile then bounces between the side wall and the top layer of bricks, clearing them rapidly without further intervention. This demonstrates the policy has learned to exploit the environment's geometry for maximum efficiency.

*   **00:18 & 00:25:** Two termination events occur, highlighting weaknesses in the policy's robustness.

**Control Error Analysis:**

*   **Failure 1 (00:18):** The policy shows a lack of adaptability. When the projectile unexpectedly breaks out of the established tunnel, the agent's platform is still positioned far to the left. Its reaction to the new, more central trajectory is too delayed, causing it to miss the intercept entirely. The policy seems over-optimized for the tunneling state.

*   **Failure 2 (00:25):** The agent demonstrates poor low-level control. As the projectile descends on the left, the platform makes a small, inefficient movement to the right before attempting to correct. This hesitant action results in a fatal delay, indicating a flaw in predicting the intercept point for this specific trajectory.
