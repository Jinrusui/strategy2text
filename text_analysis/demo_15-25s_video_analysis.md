## Technical RL Policy Analysis

**Technical Analysis of Agent Policy**

**Key Moments & Policy Observation (0:00 - 0:07):**
The agent exhibits a consistent and effective policy of "tunneling." It repeatedly directs the projectile to the far-right side of the playfield, successfully clearing a vertical channel through the bricks. This is an advanced strategy aimed at getting the projectile trapped above the brick layer, which maximizes point scoring efficiently. The agent's control is precise in maintaining this pattern, indicating a well-formed policy for this specific objective.

**Control Error & Failure Analysis (0:07 - 0:09):**
The policy breaks down when the projectile deviates from the established pattern. At 0:07, the projectile rebounds off the left wall. The agent's platform is initially positioned correctly on the left side for an intercept. However, as the projectile descends, the agent incorrectly moves the platform to the right, completely misjudging the intercept point and allowing the projectile to pass. This suggests the policy is over-fitted to its tunneling strategy and lacks the adaptability to react to unexpected trajectories on the opposite side of the screen.
